# Division template historical names system. Is a new method of naming the divisions based on the names-group assigned to it's template.
## If we run out of all historical names, the names will be assigned in the old way.
##
## Each group has a made up tag. Use it if you want to append more, or replace existing names with the extra txt files (modding).
##
## for_countries - lists all countries that can use it. If empty, or entire tag is missing, all countries in the world can use it.
##
## can_use - is a trigger that locksunlocks the group under specific circumstances. The trigger is in a country scope.
##
## division_types - is a list of tokens to corresponding unit types. A player can in fact use any group of names for a div.template
##                  however this tag is a helper for an automated choice (for AI, or if the group must switch on it's own, because
##                  for exaJORe the current one is no longer available due to the can_use trigger saying so).
##                  In automated choice, the division template must have at least 1 of the following types for it to be chosen.
##
## fallback_name - Is going to be used if we run out of the scripted historical names. If you want to use the old division naming
##                 mechanics to be used for fallbacks, then just skip this option.
##
## unordered - It's a list of historical division names that did not have a number. Regardless if such names happened in history or not
##             this option is available here mainly for a mods.
##
## ordered - Is a list of all historical names. 
##           Numbers must start from 1 and up. 
##           Numbers can't repeat in one scope.
##           If you script the name for this group, at the same number (for exaJORe in a mod in another file), the name will be override.
##           All arguments between the brackets must be separated by spaces. Each argument is wrapped in quotas.
##           1st argument = The name. It must contain either 
##                          %d (for decimal number placement)
##                          %s (for string number placement - ROMAN numbers like XIV).
##           2nd argument is optional = A localizable text describing this historical division. The text will be visible in the tooltip
##                                      where you choose the historical division name.
##           3rd argument is optional = An URL preferably pointing to the WIKI. It's a future feature that is not currently working in
##                                      the current game version.
