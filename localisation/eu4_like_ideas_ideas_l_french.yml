 idea_group_1_1: "Advisor Academy"
 idea_group_1_1_desc: "While we do have some wealthy families in our nation that we like to converse and do deals with, simply picking all of our advisors and officers from them is a recipe for disaster just waiting to strike at us. We must make a formal academy of sorts to train advisors and officers specifically for administrative measures so that we do not rely on simply 'noble ties'."

 idea_group_1_2: "Ministry of Economy"
 idea_group_1_2_desc: "Economic policy is tough to change over time, especially if the change is in reaction to something sudden in the global market. By instituting an actual ministry dedicated to handling financial law within our nation, we can better ease the burden of changing economic policy both for the commoner and for the wealthy."

 idea_group_1_3: "Trade Law Administration"
 idea_group_1_3_desc: "Trade laws are built upon traditions from the past and as such can be hard to change without great effort. We can, however, try to embolden our efforts by focusing on trade laws in particular and dedicating staff and officials to working out optimal and good trade laws that can help us grow in the long-run."

 idea_group_1_4: "Propaganda"
 idea_group_1_4_desc: "Our people have a sense of unity and loyalty to the nation and its history, but there are of course ties to other nations and cultures surrounding us. These ties are possible routes of entry for foreign ideologies to spread within our nation, something we must actively work to prevent by bolstering our own ideology and sense of self."

 idea_group_1_5: "Foreign Intelligence"
 idea_group_1_5_desc: "The use of foreign intelligence is not new in the slightest, but the ways of using it have changed as times have gone on. If we can successfully manipulate this foreign intelligence on us to be less constructive and more unclear, our enemies will have a harder time justifying any wrongful claim against us."

 idea_group_1_6: "Stable Government"
 idea_group_1_6_desc: "At the core of any good state is stability. Without a stable state, the infrastructure built on top will collapse in time and we have seen this happen several times before. We must learn from these past failures and build up a strong and stable governing body so that we do not succumb to internal collapse."

 idea_group_1_7: "The People's Work Capacity"
 idea_group_1_7_desc: "The capability of our workers is something we should always be concerned with for their health is essentially the health of the nation; without workers, a nation cannot stand! Thus, we must take steps to ensure that the administration can provide supplies and amenities to the workers so that they work at an optimal rate."

 idea_group_1_8: "Administrative Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_1_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_2_1: "Assembly Lines"
 idea_group_2_1_desc: "Separation of work in separate areas is alright, but it isn't the ideal way of producing parts in this age of rapidly innovating technology and industry. We need to input assembly lines so as to make production much more efficient and so that our factories are producing as much as they can."

 idea_group_2_2: "Improved Construction Sites"
 idea_group_2_2_desc: "Construction sites are hazardous and complicated at times, but there are certainly ways of improving the working spaces of them. If we take into account the conditions of the site, the materials needed, the staff on hand, as well as a number of other factors involved, we can try to improve these construction sites and speed up the rate at which they are getting done at."

 idea_group_2_3: "Streamlined Production"
 idea_group_2_3_desc: "With the efficiency of our factories increasing and the output of manufactured resources rising steadily, we can work on methods of streamlining production altogether. Improving the flow of work and working on the quality of working conditions in our factories will only serve to help us improve our efficiency of production, even if we may lack some required materials."

 idea_group_2_4: "Improved Mining"
 idea_group_2_4_desc: "Conditions in mines are dangerous at times and often work at them can become slow and tedious. If we take to improving conditions at them and also tackle the ever present task of improving mining equipment, we can ensure that they are working at maximum capacity and efficiency."

 idea_group_2_5: "Improved Factory Conversion"
 idea_group_2_5_desc: "Factories can serve multiple purposes, this we know all too well, but making sure both military and civilian populations have the proper amount of factories dedicated to them is another issue entirely. Converting a factory to producing for another population is by no means an easy task, but focusing on the logistical matters and coordinating the staff and workers more can result in quicker conversion rates."

 idea_group_2_6: "Additional Silo Capacity"
 idea_group_2_6_desc: "Improvments to our silos is something not many consider, but it's something the military certainly does. Heeding their words on this matter and focusing a bit of effort on silos can greatly increase the effectivness of the military in all areas."

 idea_group_2_7: "Improved Refineries"
 idea_group_2_7_desc: "It is a messy and tiresome job, but refining resources is an absolute must for a nation such as our own. If we can focus our work toward improving the refining methods we use for various resources, we'll be able to produce much more overall and shorten the refinement process for a variety of things."

 idea_group_2_8: "Economic Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_2_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_3_1: "Researching Facilities"
 idea_group_3_1_desc: "Educated minds coming out of our centers of learning can work in other places of society, but we will certainly need them for a more central use. By providing them with research centers and facilities specifically designed to further interests we have, we can bolster our own speed of innovation."

 idea_group_3_2: "Funded Research"
 idea_group_3_2_desc: "Research does not get done if its researchers are not properly fed, clothed, and taken care of. By giving them proper funding and helping them have an overall more stable job, there will be an uptick in clear, rational thought by the researchers themselves."

 idea_group_3_3: "Improved Anti-Air Artillery"
 idea_group_3_3_desc: "In the age of air power, there needs to be an effective counter against airplanes from the ground up. Investing time and energy into researching and developing more potent anti-air weaponry will go a long way toward seeing our control of the skies become a reality."

 idea_group_3_4: "Improved Intelligence"
 idea_group_3_4_desc: "It is no secret that encrypted data is needed for military and government measures and research into better encryption methods is needed. Whilst funding research into better encrypting methods, our decryption methods will increase alongside, allowing us to crack enemy codes before they are able to do harm to us."

 idea_group_3_5: "Better Aircraft Designs"
 idea_group_3_5_desc: "Aircraft are marvelous in their power and effect on warfare as we well know. Designs of them are always increasing in complexity with materials being intermixed, sometimes put in or taken out, and sometimes using more guns or less guns, depending on the aircraft we are designing. By formalizing this design process and streamlining it, we'll be able to come with increasingly better aircraft than our enemies."

 idea_group_3_6: "Improved Equipment Conversion"
 idea_group_3_6_desc: "What is the purpose of weaponry if it can only be used once, and then must be discarded until it can be broken down all the way and then remade? We need to ensure that our weapons can be used between different sections of the military at different times and ensure that our logistical situation is a cut above the rest without endangering other parts of the military overall."

 idea_group_3_7: "Trained Factory Workers"
 idea_group_3_7_desc: "Factories using unskilled workers and mere peasants straight from communities and neighborhoods is like a factory running at half of its potential. The people need training! They need a period of time to know and work with the tools of the factory before actually getting to work, that way there are less accidents and malfunctions within said factories and production becomes much more streamlined. A trained factory worker is a better factory worker."

 idea_group_3_8: "Innovativeness Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_3_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_4_1: "Communist Propaganda"
 idea_group_4_1_desc: "The information taken in by our people must not be laden with capitalist-oriented advertisements or foreign influences, they'll only serve to undermind our cause. We must regulate what news is spread throughout our lands and ensure that Communism is supported in these publications, rather than critiqued by foreign reporters and such."

 idea_group_4_2: "Communist Workers"
 idea_group_4_2_desc: "The work ethic of our people is that of the ideal communist! Or at least, that is what we strive for. Each worker doing their part for the collective and great good, whether it is in a factory, a warehouse, on a farm, or in the administration, none are exempt from work and all will be rewarded equally according to their need and work capacity."

 idea_group_4_3: "Supply Distribution"
 idea_group_4_3_desc: "We must learn to distrbute military resources like we do bread and drinks to our people, in an equal and prudent manner. It is not enough to just hope our supply lines are in good order for our forces on the front, for, we don't simply hope our people are getting the proper bread and drinks without supervision do we? Of course not! Care must be taken so that supplies are secure and safely distributed to all of our forces."

 idea_group_4_4: "Mass Army"
 idea_group_4_4_desc: "'Better' is the enemy of 'good enough'. Our army does not need to be superior in quality to our foes, it only needs to be on par with them in terms of technology, for we have the will of the people behind us, and with their support backing our great army, it will be unparalleled in size and scale."

 idea_group_4_5: "The Red Army"
 idea_group_4_5_desc: "Just how can our military be made better? One way is by making it an army explicitly for the Communist ideology and state! With our people steeped in the ideology and working for the greater good, there will be no shortage of people ready and willing to take up arms against our enemy when they need to. The larger our Red Army is, the less of a chance our foes have to make even a dent in us."

 idea_group_4_6: "The Will of the People"
 idea_group_4_6_desc: "The people themselves put trust in us to make key political and international choices, to safeguard them in times of peace and war, and to navigate the murky waters of the future; we are their instruments on the world stage. Let their faith in Communism be not false, for we will do great things in this world with their support; it is the will of the people by which we make our greatest decisions."

 idea_group_4_7: "Seize the Means of Production"
 idea_group_4_7_desc: "In prior centuries and generations, production methods were only controlled by a select group of noble families and royal bloodlines; the ownership of these means of productivity were kept away from the workers because they were deemed 'too feeble and simple-minded', but this has all changed now. Those ties of nobility and royalty are gone in their entirety, and it is the time of the workers themselves to shine on the world stage. The means of production will pave our way to victory and glory."

 idea_group_4_8: "Communist Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_4_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_5_1: "Democratic Principles"
 idea_group_5_1_desc: "The strength of our nation comes rooted in democratic principles established long before our time. We must keep true to them in these new and perhaps frightening times so that we can have a guiding light above us in the dense fog that is the Modern Era."

 idea_group_5_2: "Trained Workers"
 idea_group_5_2_desc: "The heartbeat of a functioning democracy is the workers who labor away in factories and manufacturing facilities all across our land. Not only are we going to be training them in specialized tasks for the future, but we are also going to train them to negotiate on fair terms with their employers for a fair wage and good working conditions."

 idea_group_5_3: "Free Speech"
 idea_group_5_3_desc: "What is a democracy if the common people of the land cannot criticize the government with impunity? Sure we may not like what they have to say at times, but if they can call out any sort of rot and corruption in our democratic system that needs to be cleansed for the future, then they should not be persecuted for what they say. Free speech is a dangerous tool to some nations, but democratic nations are seemingly the only ones who can utilize it effectively."

 idea_group_5_4: "Foreign Support"
 idea_group_5_4_desc: "Other nations around the globe are in danger of succumbing to foreign nations whose ideologies necessitate conquest after conquest, and the consolidation of power over time through annexation of land. Democracies must stand for these lowly nations and guarantee their freedom whenever it is possible; they do not deserve to be just another victim of a greater power."

 idea_group_5_5: "Domestic Market"
 idea_group_5_5_desc: "The internal economy promoted by democratic governments is different from those markets cultivated by say, Communism or Fascism. Our domestic market is much more robust and efficient than other ones and as such is able to withstand more dramatic shifts that might occur in our nation."

 idea_group_5_6: "Improved Oil Production"
 idea_group_5_6_desc: "Oil is becoming an ever more essential part of a functioning democracy as machines both for civilians and workers alike need oil in a variety of forms. By focusing more resources toward the refinement and production of oil for our growing democracy, we will be able to project our power further onto the world stage."

 idea_group_5_7: "Dry Docks"
 idea_group_5_7_desc: "And just like how oil is key for a functional democracy, naval fleets are much the same in this regard. To help protect not only our own shores, but also to protect foreign lands that are friendly to us, we must put an emphasis on the dry docks so that our ships can be more readily produced, repaired, and maintained."

 idea_group_5_8: "Democratic Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_5_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_6_1: "Fascist Propaganda"
 idea_group_6_1_desc: " "

 idea_group_6_2: "Warmongers"
 idea_group_6_2_desc: " "

 idea_group_6_3: "Improved Division Coordination"
 idea_group_6_3_desc: " "

 idea_group_6_4: "Military Police"
 idea_group_6_4_desc: " "

 idea_group_6_5: "Foreign Divisions"
 idea_group_6_5_desc: " "

 idea_group_6_6: "Revanchism"
 idea_group_6_6_desc: " "

 idea_group_6_7: "One People - One Leader"
 idea_group_6_7_desc: " "

 idea_group_6_8: "Fascist Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_6_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_7_1: "Trade Deals"
 idea_group_7_1_desc: "Trade. It's the nature of a globally connected world to promote trade between nations, between people, and between groups of people. If we are to make a stake in the world and establish ourselves more prominent in the trading sector, we need to carry ourselves with the utmost care in trade negotiations and make a concentrated effort to get our nation the best trade deals there is."

 idea_group_7_2: "Reduced Exports"
 idea_group_7_2_desc: "Concentrating our resources into our market will be crucial later on and help garner more profitable trade deals on the wider global market. We're not going to be sacrificing our resources on the market, let others do that!"

 idea_group_7_3: "Ministry of Trade"
 idea_group_7_3_desc: "Decentralized regulation of trade within our government is going to stagnate part of our economy undoubtedly. Let us centralize it through a proper ministry and formalize how we conduct laws and policies regarding trade overall, whether it is in tariffs or in resources production and regulation."

 idea_group_7_4: "Improved Resource Gain"
 idea_group_7_4_desc: "As tools improve, so must our regulations regarding how resources extracted get to be used. By reducing the amount of complexity there is to get resources to be used properly in our nation we can effectively increase the overall production of resources within our borders."

 idea_group_7_5: "Better Trade Convoys"
 idea_group_7_5_desc: "Larger ships, bigger and stronger hulls, and safer transportation are all key to ensuring that our convoys are reputable as well as profitable. Implementing such measures into our own nation's convoy system will bolster our own power in trade."

 idea_group_7_6: "Connected Merchants"
 idea_group_7_6_desc: "Communication is key, is it not? Merchants of our affiliation need to communicate with each other effectively and clearly so that when they spot enemy vessels out on the water, they can relay the information back as quickly as possible and as clearly as possible. Merchants are a good "neutral" party for just such a task like this."

 idea_group_7_7: "Modern Pirates"
 idea_group_7_7_desc: "Whoever said the age of piracy was dead? They certainly don't know how to perform piracy and how to make it profitable in the modern day, I say! Investing time and effort into researching more effective ways to raid enemy convoys is just modern piracy at its finest, and best of all, it's benefiting us."

 idea_group_7_8: "Trade Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_7_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_8_1: "Supporting Foreigners"
 idea_group_8_1_desc: "Foreigners are key to any nation, whether it is in their economy, reputation, or trade sector. By taking a more friendly stance toward foreigners and befriending more nations rather than alienating them, we can affirm our international standing as well some of the larger international agreements we are involved in."

 idea_group_8_2: "Domestic Policy"
 idea_group_8_2_desc: "A coherent and cohesive domestic policy should be near the top of our priorities. Effectively dealing with the various political entities within our own nation is key to functioning as a whole and if we can get a firm grip on good domestic policy, we will be set to reach outwards."

 idea_group_8_3: "International Workers"
 idea_group_8_3_desc: "Though they may not share the same ideals as our own people nor the same culture and language, we can still use international workers for a number of things. From improving international relations to learning about other nations in general, we should not be so sternly opposed to workers from abroad."

 idea_group_8_4: "Peaceful Diplomacy"
 idea_group_8_4_desc: "The pen is mightier than the sword, some say, and indeed this has been true in many cases. We would be wise to lay down our weapons when we can have civil talks over various disputes since it's always easier to start a war than it is to end one. We need not spill blood when it is not necessary."

 idea_group_8_5: "Diplomatic Support"
 idea_group_8_5_desc: "When another nation is in a tumultuous time, it might be in the best interest of our nation to be there for said nation. Diplomatic support can be one of the most powerful tools we can use on the international stage and practicing its use is something we should get used to as we grow in power."

 idea_group_8_6: "Kind Treatment"
 idea_group_8_6_desc: "People are not likely to respond kindly to harsh treatment, but they are much more likely to respond at least less violently if there is kind and empathetic treatment. Let us restrain our use of violent raids and crackdowns on rebellious people; we need to understand and talk with them rather than show them the weapons of war."

 idea_group_8_7: "Ideological Acceptance"
 idea_group_8_7_desc: "The ideologies of today may have tainting effects to some nations, but to us, they are but mere ideas to be debated on the stage in front of many people. Let the people decide what they wish to follow, but they will know what the administration they live under supports."

 idea_group_8_8: "Diplomatic Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_8_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_9_1: "Voluntary Intervention"
 idea_group_9_1_desc: "Intervening in a conflict abroad with the full support of the government is akin to basically declaring support for one side or another; by then, we might as well send our entire military force into the conflict! We must not be so heavy-handed with this decision making on a national level and instead go for a volunteer-intervention approach so as to keep our own national stance safe. With this, we can still very much influence foreign conflicts without much backlash."

 idea_group_9_2: "Volunteer Platoons"
 idea_group_9_2_desc: "Organizing volunteer forces and the system that goes into formulating volunteer forces is key to our intervention strategy. Streamlining things and preparing our people, or, at least those who want to actually volunteer for the conflict is needed so that our forces have more success."

 idea_group_9_3: "Early Intervention"
 idea_group_9_3_desc: "We must be keen watchers and firm supporters of various causes that align with our own nation and ideology. When a conflict breaks out that is not a full-scale war but large enough to warrant intervention, we must be on top of things from the very start and be ready to intervene on behalf of our own interests."

 idea_group_9_4: "Improved Foreign Policy"
 idea_group_9_4_desc: "Foreign relations and foreign policy are of the utmost importance to just about every nation there is. As with such a matter, we need to both learn from how past failures in foreign policy can shape our current understandings and also we need to make sure our foreign policy is comprehensive rather than completely narrow-minded and one-sided. Improvements on this front will help ensure that we don't end up in a diplomatic crisis of some sort."

 idea_group_9_5: "Alliance Efforts"
 idea_group_9_5_desc: "Formal alliances are what help keep a nation afloat in the world; if a nation has no alliances, there must be good reason for it and it will likely be partitioned or annexed in some fashion soon. With our foreign relations being a high priority for us currently and for the near future, alliances should be relatively easy to come by in time."

 idea_group_9_6: "Intervention Aspiration"
 idea_group_9_6_desc: "Intervention is a better means of keeping the world a safe place rather than outright war. If we can intervene and prevent escalation in conflicts then we can settle them in a quicker and simpler manner than if we willingly let it spiral out of control. Aspiring to intervene is not such a bad thing, at least when it's in our own interests."

 idea_group_9_7: "Military Intervention"
 idea_group_9_7_desc: "When push comes to shove in crises, there must be the military on stand-by, ready to enforce intervention policies as stipulated by us. Though this will be seen as an escalation by some, we can assure others that this is for the good of all parties involved and that military intervention was or is needed. If they choose not to understand, then we have other means of making them come to terms."

 idea_group_9_8: "Intervention Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_9_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_10_1: "Legitimate Government"
 idea_group_10_1_desc: "Despite what may happen to us, what atrocities and what setbacks we may endure, we must continue to perservere and overcome the hardships to instill a sense of hope and undying will to fight on in our people."

 idea_group_10_2: "Natioal Intelligence Agency"
 idea_group_10_2_desc: "Knowing what is going on inside and outside of our nation is key, but organizing that information and also obtaining that information is what eludes us so far. Forming a central agency for these tasks is what can truly bring us into the next age of informatin utilization."

 idea_group_10_3: "Domestic Propaganda"
 idea_group_10_3_desc: "With an intelligence agency now properly set up within our own administration, we can work on ensuring the loyalty of our people through the spread of our core ideas. Not only this, we can even start working to shield them from propaganda from foreign states."

 idea_group_10_4: "International Intelligence Agency"
 idea_group_10_4_desc: "With the world at large quickly becoming more and more intriguing and vital to the survival of our nation, we need to split off the international side of the intelligence agency from the national side. Having a seperate space for purely international affairs will allow us to work on those matters in a much more refined manner."

 idea_group_10_5: "Embassies"
 idea_group_10_5_desc: "Making introductions via formal delegations to foreign states is good, but not quite enough as we enter into the next era of information circulation. In order to improve our relations abroad in the hopes of gaining allies or possible vital information in the future, we should work on establishing formal embassies within foreign nations."

 idea_group_10_6: "Propaganda News"
 idea_group_10_6_desc: "'This just in, your news media is just fine and working as normal; the administration is doing all it can to ensure your safety and well-being through both tried-and-true methods and also innovate new strategies.' That is the kind of message we want to display to our own people to encourage stability and trust in the government. News outlets should be with us on this, for if there is a lack of stability, how will they even work?"

 idea_group_10_7: "Voluntary Conscription"
 idea_group_10_7_desc: "We would rather not strive to force people into military service if they do not want to since we understand that having a functioning and working internal market of different jobs is a good thing. If we can instill enough trust in the people toward the government itself, then we will have more and more people signing up to become voluntary fighters."

 idea_group_10_8: "Influence Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_10_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_11_1: "Improved Radar"
 idea_group_11_1_desc: "The radar systems we have developed already are fine, but with enemy states and fellow allied states constantly working on improving their ship designs to be less detectable to radar, we need to make sure our radar systems are being updated regularly and our military scientists devising new methods and technologies that help our detection methods."

 idea_group_11_2: "Improved Sonar"
 idea_group_11_2_desc: "Whilst our radar systems are coming to be a priority for naval vessels above the surface, our vessels using sonar are sorely lacking in attention. If we can designate some brain power toward improving our sonar systems so that our vessels can detect submarines from a further distance and with greater precision, then we'll be in a naval position of power that few can match."

 idea_group_11_3: "Secondary Cannons"
 idea_group_11_3_desc: "Whilst main guns on a ship (especially capital ships) are fine to focus on, secondary guns are also crucial to ensuring naval battles go our way. That extra amount of firepower on our side, along with the fact that more shells going at the enemy of course means more chances to hit them and deal critical damage, is going to be needed when the heaviest and largest ships confront each other on the high seas."

 idea_group_11_4: "Improved Steel"
 idea_group_11_4_desc: "The steel hull of a ship is what some people fail to focus on, and it is to their detriment that they fail in this regard. We understand though that steel hulls of high quality can and will hold up better against enemy guns and torpedoes, and when we need our hulls to withstand enemy assaults in the open water, high quality steel is what will make the difference in pitched battles where nothing is held back."

 idea_group_11_5: "Improved Gun Fire Control System"
 idea_group_11_5_desc: "Calculating how far an enemy ship is from where you are and also knowing how much lead you must give your shot before firing is what our fire-control systems do and they are absolutely crucial to scoring direct hits on enemy vessels. By making sure the electronics inside our ships are able to effectively track targets and calculate the necessary details for leading a shot no matter the circumstances, we will ensure our hit rate is unmatched around the world."

 idea_group_11_6: "Improved Naval Mines"
 idea_group_11_6_desc: "Some don't see the value in improving naval mines since they're such a gamble on whether or not they will be effective, but if enough effort is put into them so that they can perhaps remain undetected for longer and also deal more damage when they detonate, then enemy ships will be more likely to be decommissioned with a single mine."

 idea_group_11_7: "Efficient Armor Design"
 idea_group_11_7_desc: "In our factories and workshops, armor for the various vessels of the sea we produce is produced at enormous rates. And yet, despite these great rates of production, we are not getting as much out of the armor as we should in terms of combat effectiveness. Perhaps it is our outdated designs? Or our outdated thoughts on ship armor? Either one could be the compounding factor or it could be both, but regardless of which one it is, we should put an emphasis on refining the armor designs of our ships so that they can take more punishment on the high seas when push comes to shove."

 idea_group_13_1: "Military Academies"
 idea_group_13_1_desc: "An officer in training must be trained astutely and in the proper setting, not in an environment that will prep them for civilian life like a university. There must official academies for our officers to go to so that we can properly teach them how to utilize tactics, strategy, and the parts of the nations' resources in conjunction with military measures."

 idea_group_13_2: "Offensive Training"
 idea_group_13_2_desc: "Skilled leaders must be versed in both offense and defense, but there is a distinct advantage in training for offense as opposed to defense. It forces the officer or commander in question to think more on their feet and promotes a more well-rounded way of thinking of strategies and tactics. Defensive training can come later on, we simply must focus and concentrate on our leaders commanding good and proper offensive operations."

 idea_group_13_3: "Experienced Leaders"
 idea_group_13_3_desc: "At the core of an officer or a leader in the military is their ability to learn; learn from mistakes, reading, watching, hearing, and whatever other means there are for communicating ways of improvement. The more we instill this into our officers, the better off they will be in the future both when commanding divisions and when functioning as military staff."

 idea_group_13_4: "Military High Command"
 idea_group_13_4_desc: "Establishing a centralized and well-funded and well-run military command structure is crucial in maintaining a high quality military overall. Without proper orders being given out and communicated clearly, and without logistics being handled properly, we will suffer in every battle we take."

 idea_group_13_5: "Improved Army Infrastructure"
 idea_group_13_5_desc: "Barracks, storage facilities, supply depots, military bases, everything concerning military infrastructure is vital to keeping the military running smoothly and efficiently. If we invest some time and effort into maintaining such places, we will be one step ahead of our enemies and ready for more situations as they come forth."

 idea_group_13_6: "Improved Organization"
 idea_group_13_6_desc: "Strategy and tactics are actually different things when looking at them from the perspective of military commanders. Plans for both tactical parts and strategic parts need to be sorted out cleanly and thoroughly before they are put into action so that possible oversights and mistakes are caught before they make it into the final tactical and/or strategic operation at hand."

 idea_group_13_7: "Field Supplies"
 idea_group_13_7_desc: "It may be a simple thing to realize but so many nations and militaries forget about it: Supplies for the front line! Troops need calories and hydration whilst out in the field of battle and if our leaders can provide such resources to them, they'll be more active, better prepared, and perform much more effectively than without said field supplies."

 idea_group_13_8: "Leadership Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_13_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_14_1: "Better Command Structure"
 idea_group_14_1_desc: "A solid command structure for a military is essential for just about anything. If one doesn't have a solid command structure, orders can get lost or miscommunicated and having a cohesive and unified military force becomes much harder to do. Thus, our work to create a unified and operational command system that our military can use effectively will be for the good all in the future."

 idea_group_14_2: "Quality Training Equipment"
 idea_group_14_2_desc: "To train with wood is fine, but to train with steel is better, is it not? Weapons that simulate real recoil and reload times and equipment that functions like actual battlefield equipment, they are all vital to making sure our troops get a solid feel for how a true fight with the enemy will go and how doing battle will be like. If we train them with less-than-adequate materials, they won't know what to expect."

 idea_group_14_3: "Better Rations"
 idea_group_14_3_desc: "The meal of a soldier is key to them staying in the fight; mystery meat as a ration meal is not something that will keep them in the fight, that's just a fact. By providing better rations and improving the way we sort them out per soldier, we can improve our military's overall capability of staying in battles and holding ground when needed."

 idea_group_14_4: "Military Legacy"
 idea_group_14_4_desc: "Through the past military history of our nation we can garner real insights into what has and has not worked for our troops. All parts of our past that concern the military should be examined and and learned from so that our armies today emulate the successes we had in the past whilst avoiding the things that led to failure."

 idea_group_14_5: "Memories of the Past"
 idea_group_14_5_desc: "Our past is littered with instances of conflict and war that we remember quite well. Whether they were victories or defeats, our soldiers should know of them and know exactly what went into those battles and wars from start to finish so that they can better understand how modern warfare emulates the past in many ways, but also deviates from it. Being stuck in the past will destroy the military, but having no solid foundation to build off that anchors itself in lessons learned form the past will lead to nowhere."

 idea_group_14_6: "Quality Weapons"
 idea_group_14_6_desc: "Our troops will need solid, reliable weapons made of high quality material that does not break or jam. What could be worse than being in the midst of a fight and your weapon suddenly breaks down mid-conflict due to poor quality ammunition or internal mechanisms? Nothing! That is why we need to minimize this possibility as much as possible so that our soldiers can keep up the attack without worry or fear of their own equipment failing them."

 idea_group_14_7: "Terrain Specialists"
 idea_group_14_7_desc: "Mountains, deserts, swamps, jungle, all need certain types of soldiers to cater to them. No mere military regular recruit without proper training can just go into each terrain and perform well. This is why we will need specialists who understand the terrain layout we will be facing; with them in our fold and actively cooperating with the military commanders and officers, operations that go through and in these rough terrain can be more specialized and adapted."

 idea_group_14_8: "Quality Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_14_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_15_1: "Expert Training Officers"
 idea_group_15_1_desc: "Training our military cadre is very important, just about every level below the highest ones need staunch and effective training from up on high. By ensuring that our officers get strict and informative training that is both rigorous and thorough, we will make sure the lower end of our military gets the best possible training."

 idea_group_15_2: "Improved Supply Management"
 idea_group_15_2_desc: "Far too often we see our supplies get misused, misplaced, or simply lost in transit from one place to another, and some of these incidents aren’t even caused by enemy attacks! It’s simply our own lack of proper oversight and refined logistical measures that is causing these issues, and once we actually confront and address the problems at hand with our supply management, we will be able to ensure all soldiers at the front are outfitted properly alongside the vehicles they move side-by-side with."

 idea_group_15_3: "Improved Mobilization"
 idea_group_15_3_desc: "From a standing idly by to being ready for action, military units need time to get ready in terms of preparing equipment and running through protocols. This period of mobilization often takes a long time in other places, but we have found ways to improve upon it in our own nation. Implementing these changes will undoubtedly assist with our future war efforts and help get our feet off the ground in any future conflict."

 idea_group_15_4: "Better Communication"
 idea_group_15_4_desc: "Communication is essential to any military force now-a-days. From an HQ several miles away to the frontline where the action is happening, communication between both ends and every place in between is something that should never be overlooked. By clearing up our communication channels and ensuring strict adherence to radio usage protocols and operations, we will be able to make our military much more efficient."

 idea_group_15_5: "Field Hospitals"
 idea_group_15_5_desc: "Hospitals, a key facet of our state back home, but a rare sight in any warzone. What is needed then is a combat-ready hospital that is equipped with basic materials for tending to wounds and sickly soldiers whilst also being mobile enough to relocate from front to front. We won’t be setting up huge concrete buildings to house surgeries and renowned doctors with a pharmacy, but we can set up at least some sort of field version where our soldiers can be brought away from the brink of death."

 idea_group_15_6: "Focus on Special Forces"
 idea_group_15_6_desc: "What is the military without a special group of people set for only certain situations? These speical forces are going to be necessary in the future to carry out tasks a normal army simply can't do and for those times, we will need as many special forces as we can get. We need to waste as little time as possible getting this part of the military in order."

 idea_group_15_7: "Human Meatshield"
 idea_group_15_7_desc: "When we are the midst of war and everything is being thrown at the enemy, who is there that would not give up their life for the cause? For the nation? For the safety of their own land? None! There are none, who would back down from the call of war when it threatens their very livelihood! When push comes to shove, we will draw upon every single person we can to turn the tide of war in our favor!"

 idea_group_15_8: "Quantity Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_15_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_16_1: "Resilient Troops"
 idea_group_16_1_desc: "Troops that are resistant to the horrors and hardships of the battlefield will improve our overall strategic success by ensuring that fewer issues arise from our troops lacking morale or lacking cohesiveness in the midst of battle. They should be able to adapt and overcome whatever comes at them and reform what ranks they were in if their original ranks get overturned for some reason."

 idea_group_16_2: "Offensive Efforts"
 idea_group_16_2_desc: "By focusing our military training material and our logistics toward a cosistently offensive approach on the battlefield, we will be able to support larger and larger offensive operations from the ground up. Few can withstand a sustained and consistent assault that is well calculated and thoroughly supplied from the very start, which is exactly what we will be striving for."

 idea_group_16_3: "National Expansion"
 idea_group_16_3_desc: "It is clear to all within our nation and to some outside of our nation that we will be needing land in the future that is not currently ours. We will put to use our finest information operatives toward justifying our expansion efforts and we will, in time, get what we need, not just what we want."

 idea_group_16_4: "Harsh Treatment"
 idea_group_16_4_desc: "When people think of rising up behind our lines (whether this is in the homeland or in newly conquered territory), we will be there to whip them into place. We need not cries for independence and rebellion in our own land and we are justified in snuffing out these fiends; they are in our own land and will get the punishment they deserve, for they will serve as an example to future folks who think resistance is a good thing."

 idea_group_16_5: "Better Organization"
 idea_group_16_5_desc: "To sustain an offensive operation, cohesive and resilient divisions of forces will be needed at all points. By implementing both better communication devices at all levels and more streamlined channels of communication, we can make sure that organized divisions stay as they are through rough frontline conditions."

 idea_group_16_6: "Improved Military Vehicles"
 idea_group_16_6_desc: "A man can travel only so far in a day; a horse can do much more than a single man, but is still limited by natural muscles and needs. Machines, however, like trucks and tanks, are limited by how well we engineer them and how much fuel is around. By utilizing more machines in our offensive operations and engineering them for longer term operations, we can improve our military zeal and fighting power at a steady pace."

 idea_group_16_7: "Machines over Humans"
 idea_group_16_7_desc: "Much like on the battlefield, machines are becoming more and more common in factories in our own nation. If we can speed this process up and formalize how machines are to be used alongside humans inside our factories and manufacturing plants, then we will be able to do carry out far more efficient military research and production."

 idea_group_16_8: "Offensive Ideas Bonus"
 idea_group_16_8_desc: ""

 idea_group_17_1: "Trench Warfare"
 idea_group_17_1_desc: "Gone are the days of immense trench networks spanning endless swaths of Europe, forcing a stalemate upon both sides until some new innovation in warfare was produced. Mobile warfare with tactics ranging from combined arms to amphibious assaults are what people are focusing on and for good reason, but we should not forget some of the lessons that the first World War taught us. Immense trenches may not be normal anymore, but fortifying some positions with calculated networks of trenches and well built bunkers to help lock places down will absolutely help provide a key defensive advantage for our forces no matter where they are."

 idea_group_17_2: "Legacy of the Great War"
 idea_group_17_2_desc: "Whilst our remembrance of entrenchment has done us well so far, what also must be figured out is how quickly we set up these trenches alongside what they should function as. If we develop a system of outlines and layouts for our various trench networks combined with bunkers built into defensive positions, then we can be more effective if and when we are put on defense by our enemy; haphazardly making strange trench lines with little to no communication with other sectors could seriously break up our cohesion on a single front or even multiple fronts."

 idea_group_17_3: "Concealed Industry"
 idea_group_17_3_desc: "The strength of bombers is unmatched when it comes to possibly striking without repurcussions; whereas naval vessels and command units can strike at designated points, they have limitations that bomber aircraft simply do not have to deal with. This is especially true when we see the destruction brought to our industrial sectors across the nation since bombers can and have dropped their payloads on them, much to our dismay. Whilst we develop anti-aircraft measures on the side, what we should be doing for the industry sectors too is concealing them in various manners, whether it is with top-down camouflage or simply making duplicate buildings that serve no real function but look like the real factory structure. If we can fool even just a few bombing runs on us, who knows how much industrial output we'll be saving."

 idea_group_17_4: "Frontline Trains"
 idea_group_17_4_desc: "There is something to be said about transporting materials and troops to the front in a quicker fashion. Hiccups in this process are plentiful as we have not perfected the train routes and logistical approaches to the various frontlines that we have and will see in the future, yet we know that perfecting this entire matter is crucial to making sure that our military is never without extra manpower, food, water, cleaning supplies, fortification material, or even simple clothing."

 idea_group_17_5: "Fortification Experts"
 idea_group_17_5_desc: "Examining how defensive structures should be built is a topic some think should be reserved for the academy folk in our homeland, but realistically speaking, knowing what terrain to build on and where the avenues of attack are likely to come from are very valuable for our engineers. The soil, the ridges, the hills, the marshes, the everything! They will all be part of our training regimens for our engineers and more as we continue to focus on an impenetrable defensive barrier for enemies to break their weapons upon."

 idea_group_17_6: "Defensive Training"
 idea_group_17_6_desc: "And as the training regimens at the common soldier level make their way around the entire military of our nation, they will slowly start to make an impact on our commanding cadre of officers and commanders. Over time they will learn to mesh well with the soldiers beneath them and the defensive mindset we have been cultivating, working in tight unison with them when it comes to knowing how to reinforce a frontline, where to construct a bunker, when trenches are viable to be constructed and also in what manner, and even how to help conceal friendly forces from incoming enemy fire. It is not an easy mindset to grapple with at times, but it is vital for the survival of not only our military, but our nation as a whole."

 idea_group_17_7: "Guerilla Warfare"
 idea_group_17_7_desc: "Resistance is never futile! Not when the enemy has seized our capital, not when our enemy has taken the lives of our loved ones! The suffering induced by our enemy only stokes the righteous flame of undaunted resistance in us all no matter the age, and when what was once our own land is under enemy occupation for prolonged periods of time, the underground system of resistance will ensure that no street or avenue is out of our reach. Rest assured, brothers and sisters who fight amidst unceasing odds and unwavering terror by our enemies, we will return for you and the very land you defend!"

 national_ideas_1000_1_desc: "As shown most recently in the Great War, any future conflict will be an industrialized one. To prepare for any upcoming wars or the future as a whole, a strong, modern industrial base is needed."

 national_ideas_1000_2: "Improved Industrial Zones"
 national_ideas_1000_2_desc: "Factories are a marvel of modern engineering and technology but without proper infrastructure and organization, even the most impressive factories will just become monuments to human shortsightedness."

 national_ideas_1000_3: "Secured Trade"
 national_ideas_1000_3_desc: "We may not be able to contend with the great naval powers of the world, but we have to be able to protect our own amongst the endless waves of the seas and oceans! Our trade is valuable and worthy of protection!"

 national_ideas_1000_4: "Defensive Army"
 national_ideas_1000_4_desc: "The first and foremost objective of any proper army should be the protection of its people and country. Defending our interests abroad is also important, but our country can't have interests if it doesn't exist anymore or is highly vulnerable to enemy invasion."

 national_ideas_1000_5: "Air Force"
 national_ideas_1000_5_desc: "The war in the air is the future of warfare! The ability to spot and harass enemy troops miles behind the actual front line is unique to airborne units, and the possibility to destroy enemy industrial zones from afar can force an otherwise unachievable surrender."

 national_ideas_1000_6: "Capital Ship Fleet"
 national_ideas_1000_6_desc: "A small but properly organized fleet can contend with a much bigger opponent, but superior organization and tactics can only do so much for ships on the water. If we truly want to call the seas our own, we have to invest in bigger,more heavily armed vessels that are capable of taking on some of the foremost ships in the world's waters today."

 national_ideas_1000_7: "Political Power"

 national_ideas_1_1: "The Air is Ours"
 national_ideas_1_1_desc: "The air is the new frontier for warfare and every great power knows this. Circumventing the limitations of Versailles with training and development in Russia is already successful for us. Early experiments with rockets have also yielded interesting results, allowing for the design of rocket-powered weaponry and maybe even combinations with aircraft. Expanding these efforts and ensuring technological and tactical supremacy in the air will allow us to take on even the mightiest foes!"

 national_ideas_1_2: "A Blitz Across the Lands"
 national_ideas_1_2_desc: "The tank is one of the most notable inventions of the great war. Combining their speed and power with the traditional concepts of German Movement war opens up new ways to exploit enemy weak points. Short, fast, and powerful attacks that are spearheaded by a dense concentration of armored and motorized/mechanized infantry formations with close air support will allow us to ensure swift victory against our enemies. The deployment of state-of-the-art radio to our tank battalions will allow us to outsmart our opponent and coordinate the most effective attacks."

 national_ideas_1_3: "German Work Ethic"
 national_ideas_1_3_desc: "Diligence and honesty are inherent traits of the German people. "Ungerman" elements of society that refuse to do their part for the greater good will not be tolerated. These turbulent times do not allow for individualism, they demand that we surrender ourselves for the greater good. The order is simple: Fight, Work, or Perish!"

 national_ideas_1_4: "Guard our Secrets"
 national_ideas_1_4_desc: "Hiding our plans from the curious eyes of the world is what we need to fulfill our ambitions of the future. The Enigma encryption machine has proven useful in that regard and is, utilizing even the most modern equipment, unbreakable. Improving this magnificent machine even further will make our movements impossible to predict."

 national_ideas_1_5: "No Mercy for Scum"
 national_ideas_1_5_desc: "Enemies of the Reich are everywhere. Insurgencies and resistance movements are inevitable, but that does not mean we have to tolerate them. Local garrisons should not be limited in what actions they may take against rebels and partisans. Raids, public executions, or deportations are all options on the table. Death to the enemies of the Reich!"

 national_ideas_1_6: "Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer"
 national_ideas_1_6_desc: "Obedience is the highest virtue. Diversion means failure, for one stick is weak, but a bundle of sticks can endure. We have to work together, in these trying times more than ever. We are one Volk, one Reich, under one Führer!"

Unemployment is dangerously high, and severe drought has led our agricultural sector to being on the brink of collapse. Only a set of major economic reforms can achieve long-lasting, sustainable recovery. Investments in large infrastructure projects are a good start, but we need to pick up the pace if we want to help the people."

From people who have not wronged us or anybody else, who instead were wronged by us for a long time, making up for our past transgressions is long overdue."

 national_ideas_2_4_desc: "It is a right of all to live in peace, safety, and prosperity. The world is in turmoil and it is our duty, to provide these rights to everyone willing to exercise them. We must no longer turn a blind eye to offenses against man happening outside our home continent!"

 national_ideas_2_5_desc: "With major oceans lying to both of our shores, we are destined to protect the seas. Our current Navy, as impressive as it may be, is not sufficient to protect the liberty of men and women all around the globe. To ensure peace and freedom for all we must expand our influence overseas and therefore our fleets must be expanded as well."

 national_ideas_3_2_desc: "We have proven time and time again that we as a nation are capable of leading the world in terms of science, innovation, and discovery. With the influx of capable thinkers and inventors from continental Europe, fleeing from various regimes of terror, we have never been in a more favorable position. We must exploit this opportunity and ready ourselves for the storm that is surely coming."

 national_ideas_4_3: "The Italian Fleet"
 national_ideas_4_3_desc: "We were the center of the civilized world, and arguably still are what with Rome in our very heart. But an undisputable fact is we are in the middle of the great Mediterranean Sea, with coastline all around us. It would be a disgrace if we failed to control what coastal land and water we have; a fleet for the Mediterranean is necessary and just for ourselves."

Ethiopia is only the beginning of a glorious campaign which will see our empire come out victorious."

 national_ideas_4_5: "Island Hopping"
 national_ideas_4_5_desc: "Control of the Mediterranean does not only mean control of the waters, not in the slightest. Ousting our enemies from any islands they may hold is an equally important task as ousting them from inland territories. Practicing amphibious landings on our own islands should simplify future landings tremendously and aid our troops in future fights."

It has been taken from us by barbarians and withheld from us for centuries upon centuries, but now we are in a position to correct the wrongdoings of old. What was once ours, will be ours once again."

 national_ideas_4_7: "Defense of Africa"

 national_ideas_5_2: "Purging Political Opponents"

Our people are strong-willed and can endure every hardship they face, but they need weapons to actually fight with.

 national_ideas_6_2: "Modern Carriers"
 national_ideas_6_2_desc: "The western devils had time to build as many ships as they like whilst we have not had this time. As such, we have had to innovate on our designs from previous decades; rarely anybody expects attacks from above, so few are actually prepared for them when they occur. In essence, we should make them play by our own rules instead of us being subservient to their rules of "western style warfare"."

 national_ideas_6_3: "Domination of the Pacific"

Becoming a respected naval power is the only logical course for our country to take since we have to travel via boat and ship outside our home territory.

 national_ideas_6_5: "Outsmarting American Vessels"

 national_ideas_6_6: "Larger Carrier Decks"

We did our best to contain this catastrophe, but even our best efforts were not enough to curb the worst parts of the war.

 national_ideas_7_4: "No to Germany"

 national_ideas_7_5: "The African Campaign"
