 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_TITLE: "Ideas Mod Introduction"
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_1_TEXT: "Hello and welcome, thank you for playing with the §YEU4 Style Ideas§! mod! This pop up is meant to introduce you into the mechanics of the mod, but you can just hit the close button to start playing. You can also disable this pop up in the §Ygame rules§!. \n\nThe picture below shows where you can find the button to open the §YIdea Window§! (marked in §Rred§!) as well where to find the custom alert tied to its mechanics (marked in §Ggreen§!)."
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_2_TEXT: "When clicking the button encircled in §Rred§! in the picture above, the §YIdea Window§! is opened. The second picture shows exactly that window. \nIt includes a variety of things, from a small general information at the top, over your national ideas and selected idea groups to your selected policies. Depending on your choice in the game rules, you will have §Y2§! to §Y26§! (by default §Y8§!) idea group slots that unlock depending on the date. In the picture below, there are already 3 unlocked slots (of which one is marked in §Rred§!), which can be clicked to open the window with the §YIdea Group Selection§!."
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_3_TEXT: "In the §YIdea Group Selection Window§! you see a list of all idea groups that you can select, split into three categories: §YAdministrative§!, §YDiplomatic§! and §YMilitary§!. Although idea groups can have effects for all of these categories, idea groups will usually focus on things of the specific category. \nHovering over the whole entry button (marked in §Ggreen§!) will list all ideas of that group as well as their effects, you can also hover over over the individual ideas to see their specific names, descriptions and effects. Clicking that button will select the idea group respectively ask you to confirm the selection. \nHovering over the small policy icon (marked in §Rred§!) will display the policies tied to this idea group, their effects as well as the other required idea group. That second idea group is colored, if you already selected it."
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_4_5_TEXT: "Below you can see how the tooltips for the policy icon (§Rleft§!) and the entry button (§Gright§!) look:"
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_6_TEXT: "After selecting an idea group, the §YIdea Group Selection Window§! is closed and the §YIdea Window§! is opened. The free slot is now replaced by the selected idea group, showing its category, its name and the individual ideas. To complete an idea, you have to click on it. You can only complete the next unlockable idea, which has a green background (marked in §Rred§!). Ideas afterwards are locked until all ideas before are unlocked. Clicking on an available idea unlocks the idea respectively asks you to confirm unlocking the idea. If you confirm, this unlocks the idea and grants you its bonuses, but costs you the required amount of £pol_power£. If you don't have enough £pol_power£, the background of the next available idea is red. The bar below the ideas indicates if you have enough £pol_power£. \nYou can also remove a selected idea group by clicking the remove button (marked in §Ggreen§!), which restores a little bit of the used £pol_power£ and removes the idea group as well as all its already completed ideas and their bonuses."
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_7_TEXT: "Per §Y3§! unlocked ideas you gain one of your national ideas. Since you have §Y7§! national ideas, you need to complete §Y21§! ideas to fully unlock your national ideas. You can hover over the modifier icons (marked in §Rred§!) to see the idea's name, description and effect."
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_8_TEXT: "Every national idea group also has 2 §YTraditions§! and 1 §YAmbition§!. The ambition is granted, when you have completed all 7 national ideas. The traditions are already active from the start. \nThe bonuses are displayed next to the name of your national idea group in a short form (marked in §Rred§!) and hovering over them displays them in a longer form."
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_9_TEXT: "At the bottom you can see your selected policies (marked in §Rred§!), which you can remove by clicking the specific policy's icon. Policies can only be removed §Y1 month§! after they were enacted, not before. \nThe §YAdd Policy§! button (marked in §Ggreen§!) to the right opens the window with selectable policies."
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_10_TEXT: "The §YPolicy Window§! shows all the policies you have at least one idea group selected for. On the top right, next to the closing button, you have a button to open the alert settings (marked in §Ggreen§!). This opens a menu with all available policies and buttons to activate or deactivate the alert for it. Furthermore, there is an arrow button (marked in §Rred§!) that opens or closes a side menu that allows to deactivate and reactivate specific alerts completely."
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_11_TEXT: "Each policy entry has a button that has a golden frame when you can select the policy (marked in §Ggreen§!). Clicking that button will select the policy respectively ask you to confirm the selection. On that button the name of the policy, its icon and its effects are listed. Hovering over a policy entry button shows those effects as well as the required idea groups. \nAdditionally to those elements, each entry also has a button (marked in §Rred§!) to directly disable or reenable the alert for the specific policy, so you don't have to search for the specific policy in the recently mentioned list."
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_12_TEXT: "Finally, you can switch your national ideas by opening the menu by §Yright clicking§! your flag (marked in §Bblue§!) in the §YIdea Window§!. This menu contains §Y3§! buttons: \nOne button switches your ideas to the generic national ideas (marked in §Ggreen§!). This button is only visible, if you don't have the generic national ideas. \nAnother button switches your ideas to the national idea group of which you meet the triggers (marked in §Rred§!). You will also get an alert, if you are able to do that. This is mostly used for ideas of formable nations, but e.g. also for the Imperial German Ideas. \nThe last button switches your ideas back to the national idea group you had before switching your ideas (marked in §Yyellow§!). This can be useful, if you switched your ideas to the one of a formable, for example, but you come to the conclusion that you like your previous ideas more. \n\nTo avoid constant switching of ideas, you can only use one of these buttons every §Y50 days§!."
 EU4_LIKE_IDEAS_STARTUP_WINDOW_IMAGE_13_TEXT: "I hope this little introduction helped you to understand the mod and its mechanics good enough. Thank you for reading and have fun! \n\nLastly, in the following picture you can see how to disable this pop up for your next game."
