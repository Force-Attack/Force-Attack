 POR_antonio_de_oliveira_salazar_desc_r56:0 "António de Oliveira Salazar was born on the 28th of April, 1889, into a modest life in the village of Vimieiro. Being just 11 years old when the monarchy fell, Salazar built many of his opinions observing and experiencing rural disdain for the chaotic, anti-clerical turbulence that defined the early Portuguese republic.\n\nContinuing the practice of his faith and pursuit of his education, Salazar became a highly respected professor of economics at the University of Coimbra. His respected academic profile eventually led to him, following the 28th of May, 1926 military coup, being granted heavy control over Portuguese economic policy by President António Óscar Carmona, where he successfully created a budget surplus for the nation despite heavy economic turmoil.\n\nSalazar's rapid success led to President Carmona delegating much of his authority to the influential yet humble minister, who now serves as President of the Council of Ministers, making him the second most powerful and most influential member of the government, going on to lead his 1933-founded Estado Novo."

 POR_bento_goncalves_desc_r56:0 "Bento António Gonçalves was born on the 2nd of March, 1902, in the Montalegre municipality, where he from a young age became a mechanical turner in various civilian and naval sectors.\n\nHe eventually began to make a name for himself in 1924 during his time in Portuguese Angola, where he took action in the support of organized labor in industries powering the Luanda Railway.\n\nFollowing later work as a member of the Navy Workers Labor Union, as well as a commemoratory visit to Moscow for the October Revolution's 10th anniversary, he was elected secretary general of the Portuguese Communist Party, which holds throughout his 1930 jailing and a second visit to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1935, growing ever-desperate, many within the Portuguese Communist Party have called for the creation of a Popular Front to lead an armed revolt against the Estado Novo. Can this new-found leftist unity survive with Gonçalves now holding power?"

 POR_jose_norton_de_matos_desc_r56:0 "José Norton de Matos was born on the 23rd of March, 1867, in the village of Ponte de Lima. Matos spent much of his early adult education first in Lisbon, going on study mathematics later in Coimbra, before finally entering military school.\n\nMatos's national service began in 1898, where he worked for Portuguese India's colonial administration. Following years of service, he eventually returned home to serve in the armed forces, eventually becoming governor general of Portuguese Angola in 1915.\n\nMatos went on to serve in the Great War as Portugal's Minister of War in the governments of José de Castro, António Almeida and Afonso Costa, before exiling himself to London following Sidónio Pais's December, 1917 coup. When Pais's rule came to an end, Matos returned to serve as Portugal's delegate to the Paris Peace Conference, only to then re-enter a quiet life in various diplomatic and governmental positions.\n\nFollowing recent national elections, José Norton de Matos stands ready as the nations old-guard, ready to guide the national transition to democracy while putting Portugal above all!"

 POR_jose_domingues_dos_santos_desc_r56:0 "José Domingues dos Santos was born on the 8th of May, 1887, in the village of Lavra, as the child of a modest working family. Santos was in the midst of completing a course in law in the University of Coimbra at the time of the monarchy's 1910 toppling, eventually making a life for himself in liberal republican politics.\n\nGoing on to serve as Minister of Labor and Social Security, Santos took modest action in the support of Portugal's working class, later being elevated to a short term as President of the Council of Ministers in 1924. Santos then continued operating in his leftist PRED before fleeing into exile following Gomes da Costa's 1926 military coup.\n\nBack in Portugal now, Santos is committed to fighting for democratic principles in the support of organized labor. Governing over difficult times in recent history, José Domingues dos Santos believes he is ready to charter a prosperous path for the nation."

 POR_rolao_preto_desc_r56:0 "Francisco de Barcelos Rolão Preto was born on the 12th of February, 1893, in the village of Gavião. Following the 1910 overthrow of the monarchy, Preto has spent every moment of his life fighting for the restorationist cause, a feat which earned him the first of many imprisonments in 1912, which he eventually escaped, fleeing abroad into Belgium.\n\nAs a refugee, Preto worked for the magazine Alma Portuguesa, developing and expanding the monarchist, social traditionalist, integralist cause he believed in, which is known as Lusitanian Integralism. After a general amnesty in 1917, Preto returned to Portugal, becoming editor of the newspaper A Monarquia, while calling for the support of economic syndicalism and collaborating in multiple attempts to overthrow the republic. Success eventually came with Gomes da Costa's 1926 military coup, which Óscar Carmona later headed, leading to Preto's influence largely diminishing under him and later Salazar's antagonism towards syndicalism.\n\nExiled once more in 1934, Preto partook in the residency of the Spanish Republic's infamous José Antonio Primo de Rivera, assisting him in the formation of his 27 points. Back in Portugal once more, Preto has pledged to fight eagerly in the support of organized labor and staunch social traditionalism. Will he usher in a new golden era for Portugal?"

With Manuel II's unexpected death in 1932, Duarte Nuno as his second cousin now holds the strongest claim to the throne, uniting the monarchist cause as rightful claimant to the Portuguese throne.\n\nWith the Brigantine dynasty back on the throne, Duarate Nuno stands ready in his fight to restore stability and pride to the nation!"

 POR_lackluster_armed_forces_desc:0 "A disastrous intervention in the Great War, as well as austerity-motivated cuts to spending have left Portugal's armed forces incapable of defending the nation. As the clock ticks forward, and conflict's heat up around the globe, we must either work to address our military's shortcomings, or do all that we can to keep it away from the frontlines."

 POR_disgruntled_republicans_desc:0 "Liberals and socialists throughout Portugal have made clear their unwillingness to cooperate with our plans for the nation.
