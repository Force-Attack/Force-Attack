 SCA_iceland.1:0 "Consider an Invasion of [ICE.GetNameDef]"
 SCA_iceland.1.t:0 "Consider an Invasion of [ICE.GetNameDef]"
 SCA_iceland.1.desc:0 "Denmark has fallen, but their subject, [ICE.GetNameDef], remains free from [GER.GetAdjective] interference. However, we have reliable reports that suggest that [GER.GetNameDef] may be interested in Iceland as a staging ground for an invasion of Scotland. Despite our diplomats' best efforts, [ICE.GetNameDef] remains staunchly neutral in this conflict. This has led to calls for an invasion of [ICE.GetNameDef] to force their compliance."
 SCA_iceland.1.a:0 "[ICE.GetNameDefCap] cannot fall to [GER.GetNameDef]!"
 SCA_iceland.1.b:0 "We must respect their decision."

    SCA_iceland.2.a:0 "We have little choice then."
    SCA_iceland.2.b:0 "NEVER! ([ENG.GetNameDefCap] declares war on [Root.GetNameDef])"

 SCA_iceland.3:0 "[ICE.GetNameDefCap] Affirms Support for Democracy"
 SCA_iceland.3.t:0 "[ICE.GetNameDefCap] Affirms Support for Democracy"
 SCA_iceland.3.desc:0 "In a recent bid for support, the leader of the Alþýðuflokkurinn party has declared his support for the total independence of Iceland and has called for a referendum to be held as soon as possible. The leaders of the other parties have rallied behind this call."
 SCA_iceland.3.a:0 "FREEEEDOM!"
    SCA_iceland.3.a.tt:0 "Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn becomes the democratic party."

 SCA_iceland.4:0 "[ICE.GetNameDefCap] Requests Volunteers"
 SCA_iceland.4.t:0 "[ICE.GetNameDefCap] Requests Volunteers"
 SCA_iceland.4.desc:0 "One of our small partners, [ICE.GetNameDef], has requested volunteers to help them drive the revolution forward. Although not powerful, [ICE.GetNameDef] is located near the British Isles in a highly strategic location. Providing them with men may be an excellent way to prepare ourselves for a possible confrontation with the imperialists."
 SCA_iceland.4.a:0 "We shall give them as many men as we can!"
 SCA_iceland.4.b:0 "We can help our small friend."
 SCA_iceland.4.c:0 "We can only provide transportation for those who wish to go."
    SCA_iceland.5:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] Sends Many Volunteers"
    SCA_iceland.5.t:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] Sends Many Volunteers"
    SCA_iceland.5.desc:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has responded very positively to our request for volunteers. They have sent over 300,000 men and enough supplies to feed them for a few years. A message from [SOV.GetLeader] wishes us the best of luck in the struggle against the fascists and the imperialists."
    SCA_iceland.5.a:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] is generous!"

    SCA_iceland.6.desc:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has responded positively to our request for volunteers. They have sent a strong force of 100,000 men to our shores along with provisions to feed them. They wish us the best of luck in our endeavors."
    SCA_iceland.6.a:0 "We thank [SOV.GetNameDef]."
    SCA_iceland.7:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] Sends Few Volunteers"
    SCA_iceland.7.t:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] Sends Few Volunteers"
    SCA_iceland.7.desc:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has responded to our request for volunteers. [SOV.GetLeader] has sent a letter apologizing for not being to send us any men officially. However, [SOV.GetLeader] says that they were able to provide transportation and some provisions for those who wished to make the journey to our shores."
    SCA_iceland.7.a:0 "It is better than nothing."

 SCA_iceland.8:0 "Fascist Coup"
 SCA_iceland.8.t:0 "Flokkur Þjóðernissinna Coup"
 SCA_iceland.8.desc:0 "In a stunning move today, members of the Flokkur Þjóðernissinna staged a sudden coup against the government. Claiming to be representing the "will of the people", Gísli Sigurbjörnsson has proclaimed himself to be the new head of government which is to be restructured away from the parliamentary model, and towards a corporatist model with Gísli Sigurbjörnsson at its head. Although there are rumors of discontent within the party, their supremacy is unquestioned, at least for now."
 SCA_iceland.8.a:0 "We shall lead Iceland to a new era of greatness."

 SCA_iceland.9:0 "Coastguard Focus Debate"
 SCA_iceland.9.t:0 "Coastguard Focus Debate"
 SCA_iceland.9.desc:0 "[ICE.GetNameDefCap]'s coast guard is not a navy in the full sense of the word. They protect our shores and our skies, but their job has remained that of a protective guard force. It is time that we decide if they are a guard force or indeed the navy and air force of [ICE.GetNameDef]."
 SCA_iceland.9.a:0 "They are both."
 SCA_iceland.9.b:0 "They are our navy, first and foremost."

 SCA_iceland.100:0 "Neutrality of [ICE.GetNameDef]"
 SCA_iceland.100.t:0 "Neutrality of [ICE.GetNameDef]"
 SCA_iceland.100.desc:0 "[DEN.GetNameDefCap], our partner in the union of Denmark and Iceland, has fallen to the [GER.GetAdjective] invaders. Although the government remains the same, we cannot heed anything they say, for it will be from the mouth of [GER.GetNameDef]. [ICE.GetNameDefCap] remains neutral in the conflict, but the battles grow ever closer to our shores, and some are pushing for us to help avenge our fallen brothers."
 SCA_iceland.100.a:0 "We will remain neutral."
 SCA_iceland.100.b:0 "The [GER.GetAdjective]s have overstepped their bounds; to war!"
