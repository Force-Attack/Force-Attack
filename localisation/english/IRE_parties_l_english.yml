 IRELAND_BLITZKREIG_DESC:0 "Reformed into the newly independent Republic of Ireland, de Valera stands at the head of teh new state that he himself has crafted. \n\n Though now finally free of British influence, Ireland still finds itself in a political minefield. With wars erupting on the continent, Ireland must tread carefully if it is to come out of these troubled times unscathed, carefully choosing its allies or enemies, all the while ensuring that the IRA don't drag them into a conflict that they do not want."
 IRELAND_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Emerging from a period of great instability following the 1919-21 War of independence, and subsequently the 1921-22 Irish Civil War, Ireland sits at a crossroads.\n\n Eamon de Valera has plans for the establishment of an independent republic of Ireland, whilst the Fine Gael in oppsition support the status quo of the Anglo-Irish treaty, favouring remaining a member of the commonwealth. Beyond the mainstream parties however, the IRA, and latent fascist and communist movments could still seek to alter Ireland's path..."
