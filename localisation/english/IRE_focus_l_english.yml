IRE_CARRIERS:0 "Carrier Technology"
IRE_CARRIERS_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to reform our navy, we should research aircraft carriers, a ship capable of basing bombers while at sea, which could be very useful in tandem with a reforming of our air force."
IRE_CAPITALFLEET:0 "A Grand Fleet for Ireland"
IRE_CAPITALFLEET_desc:0 "If we are to ever walk out of the shadow of Britain, we must be able to build a fleet similar to their own. While this will take a long time it will pay off in the end, extending our reach and military capablilities over the British Isles and beyond."
IRE_CAPITALFLEET2:0 "Better Battleships"
IRE_CAPITALFLEET2_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to build a grand fleet to match the British, we should look into the building of a Super-Heavy Battleship. While it will take a long time to build and will be expensive, the results should be worth it."
IRE_RUTHLESS:0 "Ruthless Interdiction Doctrine"
IRE_RUTHLESS_desc:0 "Guerre de course, or Handelskrieg, is an old tactic involving disrupting an enemy nation's trade by attacking its merchant shipping. With this, we could damage our foes without having to face their fleet."

IRE_INFANTRY:0 "An tArm"
IRE_INFANTRY_desc:0 "Military tactics and doctrines have changed since the end of the Civil War in 1923. The Irish army on the other hand has not. It is essential that we stay up to date when the outbreak of war in Europe is looking more and more likely by the day."
IRE_DIRECTIONOFTHEARMY:0 "Direction of the Army"
IRE_DIRECTIONOFTHEARMY_desc:0 "Currently our military is divided on how to proceed. Should we imitate the standard armies of other nations, or adapt the tactics and structure we pioneered during our War of Independence to conventional warfare?"

IRE_ANHONOURABLEARMY_desc:0 "Our army must be focused on order, discipline, and defence. Whilst the Citizen Army have captured the spirit of patriotism, the war of Independence and the Civil War has proven that enthusiasm alone does not win wars."
IRE_APEOPLESARMY:0 "A People's Army"
IRE_APEOPLESARMY_desc:0 "Our army must be focused on speed and quick planning, adapting some of the tactics that allowed us to defeat the British during the Irish War of Independence to conventional warfare."
IRE_PATRIOTICMOVEMENT:0 "Patriotic Movement"
IRE_PATRIOTICMOVEMENT_desc:0 "Now that we have decided to adapt our War of Independence tactics to the modern day, we should promote a campaign comparing the modern army to the Flying Columns and that we pioneered these tactics to invigorate a sense of national pride in our people."
IRE_FIGHTINGSPIRIT:0 "The Fighting Irish"
IRE_FIGHTINGSPIRIT_desc:0 "While some of our forces are having trouble adapting to our decision, many Irishmen, some in Ireland and some outside, have fought for armies such as the American or British armies. We could hire their help to assist in training our troops."

IRE_OFFICERSCHOOL:0 "Establish an Officer School"
IRE_OFFICERSCHOOL_desc:0 "Currently, many officers in our army lack proper training as a result of our armed forces being descended from a guerrilla rather than a professional army. If we were to establish an officer training school which would train civilians and enlisted personnel in order for them to gain a commission as Irish officers, it would improve the quality of our military."
IRE_BLUEBLOUSES:0 "Women's Auxiliary"
IRE_BLUEBLOUSES_desc:0 "Women have much to contribute to our nation and its defence. We must open positions to those brave daughters of Ireland who would serve their country."
IRE_FLYINGCOLUMNS:0 "The New Flying Column"
IRE_FLYINGCOLUMNS_desc:0 "While the reforming of the Army has been a long process, it is now finally complete and the nation is stronger and prouder for it, knowing that in the event of an invasion the defence of Ireland will be in strong and able hands."
IRE_AIRFORCE:0 "An tAerchór"
IRE_AIRFORCE_desc:0 "One glaring error of the Irish military so far has been the lack of any air force, seen as too unimportant and expensive. With the British on our doorstep building one of the largest air forces in the world, it is vital that we correct this if we are to stand a chance."
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE:0 "Defend the Irish Sea"
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE_desc:0 "Britain's historical strength has been its navy, with which it could defend its island from invasion. Whilst building a comparable fleet would take long, and be a costly effort, if we research and build a series of bombers capable of destroying ships at sea, we may be able to protect our shores without needing to build a strong navy."
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE2:0 "Advanced Bombing Campaign"
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE2_desc:0 "Now that we have researched naval bombers, we should use our newfound knowledge to research other kinds of bombers that can help us take the fight to our enemies."
IRE_FIGHTERFOCUS:0 "Protect Éire from Above"
IRE_FIGHTERFOCUS_desc:0 "In the event of a war, an enemy air force would be able to invade Ireland's skies with impunity. We must research aircraft that can prevent this and shoot any tresspassing planes out of the sky."
IRE_FIGHTERFOCUS2:0 "Heavy Fighter Programme"

IRE_WOMENPILOTS:0 "Women In The IRAF"
IRE_WOMENPILOTS_desc:0 "While many have been opposed to the inclusion of women in the Irish army or navy despite the service of the Cumann na mBan during the Easter Rising, attitudes are more open to allowing them to enlist in the air force, perhaps following famous American pilot Amelia Earhart's example."
IRE_AIRCOMMAND:0 "Radar Technology"
IRE_AIRCOMMAND_desc:0 "Now that we have built an air force for ourselves, we should investigate radar technology. This would allow us to detect enemy aircraft, making it easier for our planes to destroy them, as well as giving us intelligence on enemy troops and ships."
IRE_FLEXIBILITYBOOST:0 "Maintain Flexibility"
IRE_FLEXIBILITYBOOST_desc:0 "Our military factories are designed to be cheap, quick to build, and easily torn down and converted when needs be. The same ethos should apply to what we build on them. New lines need to get up and running immediately and being able to swap and start on the fly will be of great asset for this 'mobile' industrial strategy."
IRE_flexibility_boost:0 "Industrial Flexibility"
IRE_flexibility_boost_desc:0 "In the ever changing environment of war it's vital that we're able to quickly adapt and change our production lines when possible."
IRE_NAVALINDUSTRY:0 "Naval Industry Focus"
IRE_NAVALINDUSTRY_desc:0 "If Ireland is construct a fleet of any particular relevance then she will quickly need to start constructing new naval facilities. Investment into the naval industry of our nation will be a step in the right direction towards protecting the Irish Sea, and our nation itself, against foreign aggression."
IRE_SUBDOCKYARD:0 "Cork Submarine Foundry"
IRE_SUBDOCKYARD_desc:0 "Some of our naval theorists believe that submarines might very well be the naval weapons of the future. If we want to heed their advice, then we'd better start producing more of them. By developing a specialised submarine foundry and testing facility in Cork, we can focus our naval production on the development of these predator undersea ships."
ire_cork_foundry:0 "Cork Submarine Foundry"
ire_cork_foundry_desc:0 "The development of a submarine testing facility and production yard in Cork has allowed us to more efficiently produce submarines."
IRE_DESTROYERDOCKYARD:0 "Dublin Destroyer Shipyard"
IRE_DESTROYERDOCKYARD_desc:0 "Screens play a key role in any naval strategy. Ireland might not have much of a fleet to speak of at present, but our admirals know the basics. Whatever type of fleet we are likely to produce, screens will be important. A shipyard in Dublin could be adapted to focus upon the development of destroyers and light cruisers."
ire_dublin_shipyard:0 "Dublin Destroyer Shipyard"
ire_dublin_shipyard_desc:0 "We are now able to produce light screen ships at a more rapid rate courtesy of a specialised shipyard opened in Dublin."
IRE_CAPITALSHIPDOCKYARD:0 "Belfast Capital Shipwright"
IRE_CAPITALSHIPDOCKYARD_desc:0 "Making use of the Shipyards built by the British in the City, we could turn Belfast into our own naval centre, capable of producing large capital ships to dominate the seas."
ire_belfast_shipwright:0 "Belfast Capital Shipwright"
ire_belfast_shipwright_desc:0 "Belfast is one of the finest shipbuilding cities in the world and it's got even better thanks to a shipyard designed entirely to build battleships for our nation."
IRE_MILITARYINDUSTRY:0 "Military Industry"
IRE_MILITARYINDUSTRY_desc:0 "Whilst the people of Ireland would prefer peace to war, there is no doubt that war may very well be on the horizon. With an enemy across the Irish Sea and more still waiting in the wings, Ireland must build her military industry if she hopes to survive the coming storm."
IRE_HEAVYINDUSTRY:0 "Heavy Industrial Focus"
IRE_HEAVYINDUSTRY_desc:0 "Ireland is a small nation and can only spare so much space for a military arms complex. The military factories that we do build need to be built specialised for war, able to run efficient production lines and generate a high degree of output. We cannot waste our time with converting civilian factories into war-machines."
IRE_heavy_industry:0 "Irish Heavy Industry"
IRE_heavy_industry_desc:0 "We have decided to prioritise our military industry with a focus on costlier, but more efficient factories, specialised entirely for the production of armaments."
IRE_NORMALINDUSTRY:0 "Medium Industrial Focus"
IRE_NORMALINDUSTRY_desc:0 "To adapt to the ever-changing environment, it is vital that the Irish arms industry stays flexible. We might expect to be at war eventually, but that war will not last forever. We need to be able to adapt our industrial economy to war and peace in equal measure, and a medium industrial focus will do just that, with cheaper and more flexible military factories."
IRE_medium_industry:0 "Irish Medium Industry"
IRE_medium_industry_desc:0 "We have decided to approach our military industry with an adaptive approach, preferring to build several smaller military factories which can be converted to civilian factories, and vice versa."
IRE_HEAVYPRODUCTIONDRIVE:0 "Production Drive"

IRE_production_drive:0 "Heavy Production Drive"
IRE_production_drive_desc:0 "Faster, harder, and stronger: that's quickly becoming the ethos of the Irish military industry. We may not outnumber our enemies, but we will do our best to outproduce them."
IRE_DEFENSEPRODUCTION:0 "Industrial Defence Plan"
IRE_DEFENSEPRODUCTION_desc:0 "It's vital that our military industry not be crippled by enemy bombers during war-time. By constructing elaborate defence systems to protect our military factories, we will be able to minimise the damage done through enemy bombers."
IRE_defense_production:0 "Industrial Defence Plan"
IRE_defense_production_desc:0 "All of our military factories will be built partially underground and with reinforced roofing and exhausts in an effort to defend against enemy bombers."
IRE_HEAVYPRIORITIES:0 "Define the Industrial Strategy"
IRE_HEAVYPRIORITIES_desc:0 "Strategic decisions are made beyond the battlefield, too. Just as our generals must decide our army's priorities, so too must we decide upon our industrial strategy. A bi-annual committee will be set up to review our priorities and allow us to focus our production efforts on one major production line, increasing its output significantly."

IRE_ARMYTREE:0 "Reforming the Armed Forces"
IRE_ARMYTREE_desc:0 "Since the end of the Civil War, the Irish military has fallen into stagnation, and suffered from downsizing alongside economic woes. As international tensions are growing, the military must be revitalised."
IRE_IEAA:0 "Irish Economic Advancement Act"
IRE_IEAA_desc:0 "Despite gaining our freedom, the economy of our fine island has laid stagnant for quite some time and is even, in some places, decaying. With the passing of the Irish Economic Advancement Act (IEAA) the Dáil can address this vital issue. Ireland may be small, but her people are industrious, and her cities have plenty of room to grow."
IRE_ARD:0 "Agricultural Reform Drive"
IRE_ARD_desc:0 "The rural areas of Ireland are by far the most neglected by the government to date, and could easily serve as a starting point for radical economic improvement. Our farming methods are woefully out of date compared to the agricultural revolutions taking place in mainland Europe, and our infrastructure is woefully behind."
IRE_MFR:0 "Mechanised Farming Reform"
IRE_MFR_desc:0 "There's no doubt that the farming industry is one of the biggest in our nation. The current agricultural techniques used however leave a lot to be desired. Through adopting the sort of advances in mechanisation seen in the United States and in Europe, we can bring our farms up to speed. Farms feed the people, and therefore they are the lifeblood of growth."

IRE_RRMB:0 "Rural Renovations and Maintenance Board"
IRE_RRMB_desc:0 "The rural areas of Ireland are in need of considerable renovations and maintenance. There is currently no public body tasked with doing these repairs, leaving rural communities to rely on notoriously unreliable private businesses. Putting this into government hands will keep our roads well maintained in good repair. A national maintenance team will also no doubt have benefits should the nation be at war."
IRE_RRMB1:0 "Maintenance Board"
IRE_RRMB1_desc:0 "The Irish Rural Renovations and Maintenance Board work to diligently repair damaged infrastructure. In times of war, they can also be put to use repairing factories and other vital emplacements."
IRE_RRMB2:0 "Regional Maintenance Board"

IRE_ESIC:0 "Éireann Scientific Innovation Council"
IRE_ESIC_desc:0 "Our nation is greatly lacking in scientific progress compared to many other industrialised nations. Presently Ireland has very little in the way of funding for scientific research. Beginning to develop a proper scientific programme will be essential if we are to significantly develop our nation."
IRE_ESIC1:0 "Éireann Scientific Innovation Council"
IRE_ESIC1_desc:0 "The ESIC was created to help Ireland's scientific progress. A team of well-paid scientists, experts in different fields, shall work night and day to facilitate Ireland catching up with the rest of the world."

IRE_IRF:0 "Industrial Research Priorities"
IRE_IRF_desc:0 "Our national has a vital need for industry, and that need is coupled with an equal requirement for research and development. Many of our factories are decrepit and out of date. To build a modern industry, Ireland needs modern factories. Investing into industrial research will allow us to move further towards progress."
IRE_ISP:0 "Irish Synthetics Project"
IRE_ISP_desc:0 "Although our people are industrious and our island ripe for industrialisation, there is no accounting for the unfortunate lack of natural resources available to us relative to the major powers of the world. Oil and rubber are particularly problematic, so if we would like to make use of these resources in our industries, Ireland must develop a functional synthetics programme."
IRE_XPESIC:0 "Expand the ESIC"
IRE_XPESIC_desc:0 "The ESIC have been doing a fantastic job to date, but they still have room to grow. Further investment will facilitate their involvement in a greater number of research projects, enabling our teams to cover more ground and deal with more fields.

IRE_ISRA:0 "Improved Safety Regulations Act"
IRE_ISRA_desc:0 "Industrial accidents, factory sicknesses and other mishaps are frighteningly common in Irish industry. The lack of proper safety standards has been a cause for great concern among the workers and has seen them turn increasingly towards Syndicalism. We can all agree that no worker should feel like his workplace is a dangerous environment. It's time to make a change."
IRE_SAFETY_REFORMS:0 "Safety Reforms"
IRE_SAFETY_REFORMS_desc:0 "Our recent safety reforms have been a big success. Factories in Ireland could previously be dangerous environments and work-related accidents were common. Now, less workers are laid off because of injury or sickness, increasing the productivity of our industries."
IRE_SCOB:0 "The Steel City"
IRE_SCOB_desc:0 "Steel is an important resource and one of the few that Ireland can reliably produce thanks to her existing natural resources and trade connections.
