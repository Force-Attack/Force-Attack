 COG_large_scale_exercises_desc:0 "To improve our coordination and experiment with new tactics, it is imperative to organize large-scale exercises. Those exercises would involve several hundred and even thousands of men to evaluate the coordination of the different units."
 COG_river_patrols:0 "River Patrols"
 COG_river_patrols_desc:0 "The Congo Basin is the basis of the country, and its control is essential to move troops and goods. To do that, we must patrol it with light boats and train our infantry to cross it easily."
 COG_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
 COG_special_forces_desc:0 "The natural environment of the Congo could be seen as quite hostile for a foreigner. The land is covered with dense forests and jungles, defined by a large river, while rugged terrain dominates its eastern part. To allow the Force Publique to fight in these environments, we must organize troops equipped to take advantage of the terrain and turn the tide of potential combats."
 COG_jungle_training:0 "Jungle Training"
 COG_jungle_training_desc:0 "As jungle makes up a substantial portion of our territory, being able to move and fight in this hostile environment effectively is essential for the military efficiency of the Force Publique."
 COG_fortify_congo_mouth:0 "Fortify the Congo Mouth"
 COG_fortify_congo_mouth_desc:0 "Our main assets are in the mouth of the Congo River; this vital region must be protected. To fulfill that objective, we must set up a proper river corps. This new corps should be equipped with fast, small boats to patrol the whole length of the river."
 COG_fortify_cities:0 "Protect the Other Cities"
 COG_fortify_cities_desc:0 "Even if Léopoldville is secure, the other cities of Elisabethville in Katanga and Stanleyville in the "Orientale" Province are still vulnerable and should be reinforced."

 COG_air_force_congo:0 "Force Publique's Air Wings"
 COG_aviation_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YAir Base§!"
 COG_air_force_congo_desc:0 "Nowhere are technological advances more rapid than in aerial warfare. Aviation is a field any modern nation must master."
 COG_fighter_focus:0 "Import Fighter Blueprints"
 COG_fighter_focus_desc:0 "We have not seen the last of dogfights in the Great War. Keeping ahead in the development of fighter planes will give us an edge in the future."
 COG_bomber_focus:0 "Experiment with Long-Range Planes"
 COG_bomber_focus_desc:0 "People will speak of the horror of today's wars in the future, telling stories of fire raining from the skies. We will do our best to ensure those stories are told by our enemies."
 COG_long_range_fighters:0 "Long-Range Fighters"
 COG_long_range_fighters_desc:0 "To cover the vast distances of the jungle, a new concept must be developed. This is why a type of military plane intermediary between fighters and bombers is necessary to cover long-range missions and challenge enemy bombers."
 COG_radar_system:0 "Radar System"
 COG_radar_system_desc:0 "As the vastness of the Congo is difficult to patrol efficiently, a radar system would enable us to detect the enemy and fly our aircraft only when a threat is approaching."
 COG_aviation_effort_2:0 "Study Foreign Tactics"
 COG_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Further advances in aviation will be necessary to integrate our air force well with other military branches."
 COG_CAS_effort:0 "Dive Bomber Prototypes"
 COG_CAS_effort_desc:0 "A modern army needs support from vehicles on the ground and in the air."
 COG_rocket_effort:0 "Develop Jet Engines"
 COG_rocket_effort_desc:0 "Rocket and jet engines allow for unprecedented speeds for crewless and crewed vessels alike. Pioneering these technologies enables us to take the enemy by surprise."
 COG_NAV_effort:0 "Naval Bomber Experiments"
 COG_NAV_effort_desc:0 "Just as the new naval warfare takes place beneath the water's surface, part of it takes place in the air over the water."
 COG_naval_effort:0 "Begin Shipbuilding in Matadi"
 COG_naval_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YNaval Dockyards§!"
 COG_naval_effort_desc:0 "As our most modern port, protected from the high sea because it is 100Km away from the mouth of the Congo river, the port of Matadi is the ideal starting point for our naval program."
 COG_submarine_operations:0 "Convoy Raiding Tactics"
 COG_submarine_operations_desc:0 "Reinventing naval warfare to account for the advances in submarine technology will allow us to strike efficiently against enemy convoys."
 COG_large_navy:0 "Naval Tactics"
 COG_large_navy_desc:0 "Adapting our naval doctrines to accommodate large ships and ensuring the safety of our trade convoys will teach us much about what sort of ships we need."
 COG_fleet_management:0 "Fleet Management"
 COG_fleet_management_desc:0 "Our new fleet will require new tactics to be effective."
 COG_submarine_experiments:0 "Submarine Experiments"
 COG_submarine_experiments_desc:0 "Submarine warfare is the most exciting naval development since the invention of the torpedo boat. We would do well to protect against submarines and use them against enemy shipping."
 COG_cruiser_effort:0 "Experiment With Bigger Ships"
 COG_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Before making forays into advanced battleship research, the smaller cruisers need replacement."
 COG_destroyer_effort:0 "Advanced Destroyers"
 COG_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "Studying submarines' design and strategic use, we have also learned how to counter those strategies. Destroyers will be crucial for this."
 COG_capital_ships_effort:0 "Capital Ship Effort"
 COG_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "The nation with the most battleships will rule the oceans. Battleships and carriers represent the old and the new in naval superiority."
