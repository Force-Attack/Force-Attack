He also played a role coordinating the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, as well as performed as a Commodore on a number of convoys very early in the war.\n\nTobermory under Stephenson's guidance played an important part in the Battle of the Atlantic, getting escorts out to sea quickly and with effective training.

While the increase in preferential trade has allowed our industry room to grow, American producers and suppliers have been negatively affected and the American goverment is keen to support them.\n\nCanadian producers cannot compete on equal terms with their larger American counterparts, but the negative impact of restricted trade with our prosperous neighbour to the south is also costly for our economy. Britain has asked whether we would agree to extend our imperial preference policies for another five years. Our decision will likely shape the direction of our economy over the coming decade profoudly.\n\nThe choice is clear, we either extend the policies and accept the economic difficulties this may bring to Canadian consumers, or we gradually seek to withdraw these policies and attempt to maintain favourable trade with both sides as best we can."
