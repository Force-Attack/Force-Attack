When war broke out again, he was called back to service. Despite his years (he was born in 1878), he remained fit, healthy and energetic, and had the capacity to apply his incisive mind to whatever the Admiralty saw fit to assign him to.\n\nHistorically, his key contribution was running the escort working-up facility at Tobermory (Tobermory Bay is pictured below with Stephenson), where he and his team put 911 ships through 1,132 training courses. He also played a role coordinating the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, as well as performed as a Commodore on a number of convoys very early in the war.\n\nTobermory under Stephenson's guidance played an important part in the Battle of the Atlantic, getting escorts out to sea quickly and with effective training. Stephenson's innovative but challenging techniques influenced the Royal Navy's post-war working-up procedures, while also earning him the nickname 'The Terror of Tobermory'."

# Canada special event localisation
TBE_imperial_preference_canada.desc:0 "The system of imperial preference, endorsed by the Canadian Conservative Government at the Ottowa Conference in 1932 has had mixed results for Canada. While the increase in preferential trade has allowed our industry room to grow, American producers and suppliers have been negatively affected and the American goverment is keen to support them.\n\nCanadian producers cannot compete on equal terms with their larger American counterparts, but the negative impact of restricted trade with our prosperous neighbour to the south is also costly for our economy. Britain has asked whether we would agree to extend our imperial preference policies for another five years. Our decision will likely shape the direction of our economy over the coming decade profoudly.\n\nThe choice is clear, we either extend the policies and accept the economic difficulties this may bring to Canadian consumers, or we gradually seek to withdraw these policies and attempt to maintain favourable trade with both sides as best we can."
