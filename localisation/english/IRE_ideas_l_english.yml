IRE_trade_war_desc: "Since 1932 Ireland and the United Kingdom have been locked in a crippling trade war over attempts to change the constitution of the Irish Free State, and the reimbursements demanded by Britain as part of the 1921 Anglo-Irish treaty involving land Annuities and financial loans granted to Irish tenant farmers originally under the Irish Land Acts of 1870-1909. De Valera's Fianna Fáil hoped that by imposing tarriffs on British goods, Ireland could foster native industry, provoking tit-of-tat tarriffs from the British. In addition, de Valera argues that as a result of the 1925 London Agreement, that cleared Ireland's need to contribute to repayment of British public debt, Land Annunities should also be cleared - a notion that Westminster contests. The result of this spat, paired with the Great Depression, has had a devastating effect on the Irish Economy, with the fallout with its largest trade partner leaving it strapped for materials and imports, whilst native industrial development remains sorely lacking."
