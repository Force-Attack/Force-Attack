 oscillating_turret_unlock_tt: "The §0Oscillating Turret§! allows light tanks to carry medium weapons without sacrificing as much armor as superstructures and partially armored turrets."
  # until road56 pulls its head out of its ass, the lower lines of code are useless, as you cannot /replace a line in /replace.
 radio_detection: "Radio Detection"
 radio_detection_desc: "The development of RADAR, Radio Detection and Ranging, allows using radio waves to detect physical objects. Research is highly secretive, considering the impact these inventions could have on locating units."
 decimetric_radar: "Decimetric Radar"
 decimetric_radar_desc: "Many units rely on the element of surprise for their efficiency. Development of decimetric radar allows us to deprive them of this advantage."
 improved_decimetric_radar: "Improved Decimetric Radar"
 improved_decimetric_radar_desc: "The use of radar has already proven crucial, but our decimetric radar sets are too few to ensure good coverage. Fitting more units with radar will allow us to maximize our technological edge."
 centimetric_radar: "Centimetric Radar"
 centimetric_radar_desc: "Thanks to the invention of the cavity magnetron we can begin using shorter microwaves to detect objects, improving resolution of our radars to unprecedented levels."
 improved_centimetric_radar: "Improved Centimetric Radar"
 improved_centimetric_radar_desc: "Introducing cutting-edge radar techniques like phased arrays in key operations will allow for extreme tracking accuracy."
 advanced_centimetric_radar: "Advanced Centimetric Radar"
 advanced_centimetric_radar_desc: "Despite our advanced radars, there are still ways for the enemy to avoid detection. New developments like the Doppler shift radar allows us to eliminate many of these limitations in our equipment." #fucking pulse doppler wasnt a practical thing for years to come, but hoi4 threw it in as it was the last tech, so of course r56 devs didnt backtrack to make the descriptions more accurate just slapped 1943's usa radar designation on 1945 tech and called it a day
 future_radar: "Early Monopulse Tracking Radar"
 future_radar_desc: "Our Airborn Interception Radar is now quite sophisticated, and can make a visible difference in engagements. More information can be gleamed from a single well encoded pulse than from blasting the target with incohesive waves."
 future_radar_2: "Improved Monopulse Tracking Radar"
 future_radar_2_desc: "Further advances in the sensitivity and range of our systems have allowed us to develop even better units for aircraft, which are less likley to be jammed by enemy systems."
 future_radar_3: "Pulse-Doppler Radar"
 future_radar_3_desc: "Pulse-Doppler method allows the radar to distinguish between moving and static targets, allowing for effective radar usage on low altitudes. Older systems would see no distinction between the ground and the enemy plane, effectively being useless on lower altitudes."
