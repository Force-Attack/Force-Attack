 r56.startup.event.1.t: "Welcome to §RForce Attack§!"
 r56.startup.event.1.d: "This mod was built on the foundation of being able to play classic HOI4 Arcadey Nonhist games as well as Semi-Hist, RP can be done on it but some features are not included such as letters or resource sharing due to trolling and exploiting said features. \nAlot of the balancing of this mod is generalized around what nations are generally allied towards each other and based around the rulesets hosted for this mod, alot of input towards game balance used input from historical communites of Lastorical/RedBaron. \n\n§BECONOMY CHANGES§!: In this mod the total factory count of all nations is increased from the normal factory counts of Vanilla or standard 56 and its submods, with the increased factory counts the production of each factory is reduced significantly similar to TFB.\n\n§GCOMBAT CHANGES§!: Combat Width has been set to one combat width for all tiles to streamline and simplify combat, similar to how Hoi4 was before the release of NSB DLC. \nAll tiles are a combat width of 80 with an additional attack of 40, overstacking penalties are increased back to original values, recommended combat widths are 20 and 40. \nArtillery, rocket artillery, SPGS, and other artillery tech have had their width dropped from 3 to 2 to increase their viability for line combat, there are decisions for recommended division compositions, they are more for a guide rather than whats the 'best divison'\nTanks are based off of vanilla stats with small tweaks to several lesser used modules, if a design works in vanilla it will work in this mod, same goes for air. \n\nHave fun and enjoy your game of §RForce Attack§!"
