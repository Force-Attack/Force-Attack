#RDF
sp_air_rdf:0 "High-frequency Radio Direction"
sp_air_rdf_desc:0 "High-frequency Radio direction finding uses radio waves to find the location of a radio source using triangulation within seconds. Building a miniature version of this device would help locate large enemy equipment in the field such as ships and large planes. This allows us to better gain and react to direction findings without having to relay information from a larger stationary array device."
#Only tags that fielded this IRL so only tags with flavor text for it.

ENG_sp_air_fido:0 "FIDO"
sp_air_fido_desc:0 "Fog is a major problem with aircraft takeoff and landing, especially when planes return from long night time operations. Developing a system that can clear the fog and illuminate the runway would prevent accidents and reduce fog's effects on operations."
