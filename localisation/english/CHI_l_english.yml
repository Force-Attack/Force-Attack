CHI.1.t:0 "The Xi'an Incident"
CHI.1.desc:0 "During a routine visit to review his army, [CHI.GetLeader] has been unexpectedly detained by his own generals, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng. Frustrated with [CHI.GetLeader]'s relentless campaigns against the Communists, they demand a shift in strategy: cease all offensives against the Communists and redirect China's military efforts towards repelling the Japanese invasion. This bold move aims to unify China's forces against a common enemy and strengthen the nation's defenses against the growing Japanese threat."
