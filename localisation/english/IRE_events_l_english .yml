 ireland.1.t:0 "IRA Empowered"
 ireland.1.d:0 "With the IRA drawing closer to the state than they ever have before, they have started to undertake a small number of official duties alongside the Garda Síochána. We now enjoy close co-operation with them, and a great amount of loyalty."
 ireland.1.a:0 "Excellent"
 ireland.2.t:0 "IRA becomes loyal"
 ireland.2.d:0 "The IRA has become relatively close to the state, and has proven itself willing to co-operate with us on a number of minor issues. That being said, they are still somewhat reluctant to hand over complete authority to the state, and keep us at arms-reach."
 ireland.2.a:0 "Thats Good News"
 ireland.3.t:0 "IRA Appeased"
 ireland.3.d:0 "The IRA now views us as neither an enemy nor an ally, eyeing us up with suspicious, but not necessarily hostile eyes"
 ireland.3.a:0 "That's good news, I suppose"
 ireland.4.t:0 "IRA becomes disloyal"
 ireland.4.d:0 "Owing to a number of grievances with the state, the IRA has begun to swing against us, openly criticising our governmental policies, and calling for their members to provide some passive resistance to certain aspects of our government. Unless we rectify this situation soon, they may start openly turning against us."
 ireland.4.a:0 "Worrying"
 ireland.5.t:0 "IRA becomes hostile"
 ireland.5.d:0 "The IRA have now become openly hostile to us, calling for their members to actively resist the government. Worse still, we have heard rumours that they may be laying plans for some sort of coup. We must act fast if we wish to bring them back on side before it is too late..."
 ireland.5.a:0 "This is a crisis for [IRE.GetnameDef]"
 ireland.6.t:0 "The Irish Economic Advancement Act"
 ireland.6.d:0 "With the completion of the Econimic Advancement Act, we have everything prepared to set a priority for investment and advancement. The question remains therefore, what should benefit first?"
 ireland.6.a:0 "Focus on Industrial Construction Projects"
 ireland.6.b:0 "Focus on Industrial Research Projects"

 ireland.7.t:0 "The Agricultural Reform Drive"
 ireland.7.d:0 "We have prepared the state bureaucracy and governmental infrastructure to facilitate the goals laid out by the Agricultural Reform Drive. The question remains however, how much to we want to commit to this new project as a start-up investment"
 ireland.7.a:0 "Let's make a small investment to get started"

 ireland.8.t:0 "Industry for Ireland"
 ireland.8.d:0 "We have prepared the state bureaucracy and governmental infrastructure to facilitate the goals laid out by the Industry for Ireland project. The question remains however, how much we want to commit to this new project as a start investment" 
 ireland.9.t:0 "Saorstát Alcohol Factories"
 ireland.9.d:0 "Following the commencement of the IFI initiative, the Irish Department of Industry & Commerce have decided on perhaps a rather obvious choice to kick start Ireland's industry: alcohol. Ireland has a long and proud tradition of producing Irish whisky, but much of the production is done in small family-run distilleries throughout the countryside. The proposed Saorstát development will open up several alcohol factories and produce some much-needed employment for our nation, but the location for the development has yet to be decided, only that it should be in one of our less industrially developed regions."
 ireland.9.a:0 "Ulster. God knows, if anyone needs a drink, it's them."
 ireland.9.b:0 "Connacht. They need the jobs there."
 ireland.9.c:0 "Munster. They'll benefit the most from the profits."
 ireland.10.t:0 "The Pints Are Calling"
 ireland.10.d:0 "The construction of the Saorstát alcohol factories has finished, and now the nation can enjoy the benefits. The factories have not come without their expenses, but there's no doubt that they'll be good for public morale as well as the economy in the long-term."
 ireland.10.a:0 "Sláinte!"
 ireland.10.b:0 "This is getting far too expensive..."
 ireland.11.t:0 "The Coal-Cattle Pact"
 ireland.11.d:0 "An [IRE.GetAdjective] minister has appoached us to address the ongoing trade war between [ENG.GetnameDef] and [IRE.GetnameDef]. Though the conflict, which began in 1932 over constitutional changes and the land annuities due to us by the [IRE.GetAdjective], has not formally been resolved, changes in economic circumstances have been pushing us towards ironing out these past grievances. Indeed, right now, [IRE.GetAdjective] Farmers have been forced to slaughter their cattle simply because our tarriffs make their beef uneconomical for British consumers. At the same time, the growing industrialisation of [IRE.GetnameDef] has led to an increase in demand for coal - which we produce in spades, yet tarriffs are too high for our traders to competitively sell it in [IRE.GetnameDef]. By lowering tarriffs on these goods, we could finally begin to thaw this cold economic war we have been waging on one another to mutual benefit."
 ireland.11.a:0 "Sign the pact, let the trade flow!"
 ireland.11.b:0 "You think you're getting out of those repayments that easily?"
 ireland.12.t:0 "The Confirmation of Agreements Act"
 ireland.12.d:0 "[IRE.GetnameDef] officials have been closely working with our ministers over the past couple months to bring a conclusive end to the Anglo-Irish Trade War. Between them, they have drawn up the intuitavly named Confirmation of Agreements Act, which, if put into effect will bring an end to the trade war, and properly clarify, with the agreement of both nations, the status of Irish constitutional changes and the land annuities."
 ireland.12.a:0 "Let us put an end to this 'Economic War' for good."
 ireland.12.b:0 "Actually, we find these terms unacceptable"
 ireland.13.t:0 "End of the Anglo-Irish Trade War"
 ireland.13.d:0 "With the Confirmation of Agreements Act signed into being by the British Parliament, the Anglo-Irish Trade War has officially ended, and our trading companies are once more free to import and export goods across the Celtic Sea, with all tarriffs being lifted by both sides."
 ireland.13.a:0 "A Great Day for the Economy"
 ireland.14.t:0 "An opportune moment?"
 ireland.14.d:0 "The ongoing Abdication Crisis in [ENG.GetNameDef] has left the [ENG.GetAdjective] Monarchy particualy weak in Britain and elsewhere in the Empire. Within Ireland, the King has a representative within the Governor-General, who is able to weild a limited amount of influence over both our domestic and foreign policies. Naturally, as a prominent vestige of British authority and loyalty to the crown and commonwealth, the position is not well-liked by republicans and members of the Fianna Fáil in govenment.\n\n  They have suggested that this crisis in the British Monarchy is the perfect opportunity we need to do away with un-Irish oaths of loyalty to the king, and the influence of the Governor-General, though more moderate politicians have already decried following such an action."
 ireland.14.a:0 "This shall be our first step towards a republic!"
 ireland.14.b:0 "It is not worth the effort."
 ireland.15.t:0 "Industrial Strategy"
 ireland.15.d:0 "As part of our heavy military industry plans, we are able to prioritise a certain area of armaments production in order to meet and facilitate our overall strategic goals. We can greatly increase our output in any given area for a period of time, however this will cost a considerable amount of our income so it should be done wisely, if at all."
 ireland.15.a:0 "Focus on producing tanks."
 ireland.15.b:0 "Our lads need more guns."
 ireland.15.c:0 "We need more planes in the sky."
 ireland.15.e:0 "There's no need for a priority right now."
 ireland.16.t:0 "[IRE.GetNameDef] Confirms ties to the Commonwealth"
 ireland.16.d:0 "The [IRE.GetAdjective] ambassador has approached us to officially confirm that following the electoral victory of the Fine Gael over the Fianna Fáil, [IRE.GetNameDef] has moved back towards allignment with the Commonwealth, and formally has joined us once more as a dominion."
 ireland.16.a:0 "Great News!"
 ireland.17.t:0 "[IRE.GetNameDef] Seeks to join the allies"
 ireland.17.d:0 "The [IRE.GetAdjective] Ambassador has appoached us with a formal request to join the allies an aid us in the fight to preseve global democracy"
 ireland.17.a:0 "Their assistance is most welcome!"
 ireland.17.b:0 "Sadly, we cannot accept this offer"
 ireland.18.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] Sponsors our entry into the Allies"
 ireland.18.d:0 "The [ENG.GetAdjective] ambassador has approved our entry to the allies, praising our willingness to put our past grievances behind us."
 ireland.18.a:0 "We stand together"
 ireland.19.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] refuses our entry to the Allies"
 ireland.19.d:0 "The [ENG.GetAdjective] representative has informed us that, though they appreciate the offer of support, they cannot sponsor our entry to the allies at the current time."
 ireland.19.a:0 "Disappointing"
 ireland.20.t:0 "[IRE.GetNameDef] seeks to join the Axis"

 ireland.22.d:0 "The [GER.GetAdjective] representative has returned to us, declaring that, thought they appreciate the offer, they cannot allow our entry into the Axis at this time."
 ireland.23.t:0 "[IRE.GetNameDef] seeks to join the Comintern"
 ireland.23.d:0 "The [IRE.GetAdjective] representative has approached us requesting a formal invitation to the Comintern, so that they may join us in the international struggle"
 ireland.24.t:0 "[SOV.GetNameDef] Approves our entry into the Comintern"
 ireland.24.d:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective] representative has returned to us, declaring that we shall be allowed entry to the Comintern forthwith, so that we may form a united front against the enemies of the revolution"
 ireland.25.t:0 "[SOV.GetNameDef] refuses our entry into the Comintern"
 ireland.25.d:0 "The [SOV.GetAdjective] representative has returned to us, saying that unfortunately, they cannot approve our entry into the Comintern at this time."
 ireland.26.t:0 "[IRE.GetNameDef] requests the transfer of Ulster"
 ireland.26.d:0 "We have been approached by representatives from [IRE.GetNameDef] requesting that we formally transfer Ulster to their control, stating that they have proved their loyalty to Britain and the Commonwealth, and would be in a better position to both defend, and invest in the territory than British forces and English- and Scottish- based companies. Though the six counties of Northern Ireland refused by plebicite to join the Irish Free State in 1921, the region is still considered by many to be Irish territory, and the [IRE.GetAdjective] government has promised, in the event of our agreement, to work with our official overseers to ensure that Ulster protestants and unionists recive proper respect, represtantation and treatment."
 ireland.26.a:0 "Their loyalty to us deserves a reward, transfer the territory and make Ireland whole!"
 ireland.26.b:0 "We cannot accept such an offer"
 ireland.27.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] transfers Northern Ireland"
 ireland.27.d:0 "[ENG.GetAdjective] officials have responded to our request to transfer Northern Ireland positively, and have handed control of the territory over to us."
 ireland.27.a:0 "A Great day for [IRE.GetNameDef]!"
 ireland.28.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] refuses to transfer Northern Ireland"
 ireland.28.d:0 "The [ENG.GetAdjective] representatives have repsonded to our request for Northern Ireland, stating that though they appreciate our loyalty to the commonwealth, they cannot freely hand over Northern Ireland to us, stating that the results of the 1922 plebicite must be respected.
 ireland.28.a:0 "Disappointing"
 ireland.29.t:0 "Unionists and Protestants challenge [IRE.GetnameDef]"
 ireland.29.d:0 "We should have seen it coming, but our acquisistion of Ulster has led to increased resistance from Ulster Protestants and Unionists, who have begun organising and alligning themselves with paramilitary groups like the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Orange Order. They have now begun an organised resistance against our occupation, seeking to either rejoin Britain, or independence from us."
 ireland.29.a:0 "This could be a problem"
 ireland.30.t:0 "The IRA launches S-Plan"
 ireland.30.d:0 "Our contacts in the IRA have informed us that they are launching a new operation against the British. As we understand it, this S-Plan, or sabotage Britain plan, will involve clandestine attacks on British installations in England, Scotland and Wales in order to weaken their war effort and aid a possible campaign in the north."
 ireland.30.a:0 "Hopefully nothing comes of this..."
 ireland.30.b:0 "Best of luck Boys!"
 ireland.31.t:0 "The IRA initiates S-Plan"
 ireland.31.d:0 "We have been informed by members of the [IRE.GetAdjective] government that the IRA have launched a new operation against us. Though the details are still unclear, we believe that this may involve sabotage of various targets throughout England, Scotland and Wales."
 ireland.31.a:0 "We must be on guard"
 ireland.33.t:0 "The IRA strikes British Infrastructure!"
 ireland.33.d:0 "The IRA have successfully sabotaged one of our railways, blowing up a section of track on an important industrial line. Fortunately, the fault was found before a train could pass, and no-one was hurt, but the perpetrators managed to escape."
 ireland.33.a:0 "Oh No!"
 ireland.33.b:0 "Put pressure on [IRE.GetNameDef] to move agaisnt the IRA"
 ireland.34.t:0 "The IRA strikes British Military Factories"
 ireland.34.d:0 "The IRA launched a daring attack on one of our military facories, initiating a shootout with local defence forces before rendering the production lines inoperable. Several officers and workers were injured and three have been confirmed dead."
 ireland.35.t:0 "The IRA strikes a British Civilian Factory"
 ireland.35.d:0 "In a heinous move, the IRA recently bombed one of our Civilian Factories, despite the fact that it contributes nothing to our armed forces. By infiltrating under the guise of a worker, the perpetrator was able to rig a portion of the factory to blow. Though they were later captured by law enforcement, the damage was done, with the factory rendered inoperable, and leaving tens of Civilian casualties in his wake."
 ireland.36.t:0 "The IRA strikes British Dockyards"
 ireland.36.d:0 "IRA assailants have succeeded in attacking one of our military dockyards. All perpatrators were killed in a shootout with the local constabulary, but not before serious damage was done to the naval installations in the area."
 ireland.37.t:0 "IRA plot to destroy infrastructure foiled"
 ireland.37.d:0 "IRA operatives have been apprehended laying an explosive device on rail lines near one of our industrial centres after the alarm was raised by a local engineer. Though we managed to outdo them this time, there is no telling where they could strike next."
 ireland.37.a:0 "Good job lads!"
 ireland.37.b:0 "We got lucky this time, but we should still put pressure on [IRE.GetNameDef] to ensure that it doesn't happen again."
 ireland.38.t:0 "IRA plot to destroy factory foiled"
 ireland.38.d:0 "Police forces have apprehended a number of individuals that we believe to be IRA operatives in a raid on a secluded rural dwelling. There, officers found plans and supplies for the destruction of a factory in a nearby industrial region. This time at least, we were one step ahead."
 ireland.39.t:0 "IRA plot to destroy dockyards foiled"
 ireland.39.d:0 "In a climatic shootout at one of our military dockyards, our military police have succeeded in killing IRA agents who were in the process of planting explosives to destroy our docks. The explosives were recovered, and the docks were thankfully unharmed, with only a handful of casualties."
 ireland.40.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] demands we act against the IRA"
 ireland.40.d:0 "In response to recent sabotage efforts by the IRA on British soil, the [ENG.GetAdjective] ambassador has delivered to us an official request for the [IRE.GetAdjective] state to act against the IRA, and aid in the suppression of agents currently being sent from Ireland to Britain to sabotage military and civilian industrial targets. Obliging of course would damage our reletionship with the hard-line republicans, but refusal may damage our relations with Britain."
 ireland.40.a:0 "We are powerless to act against the IRA"
 ireland.40.b:0 "We will move against them then"
 ireland.40.c:0 "This cannot be tolerated. Increase patrols to put a stop to this S-Plan completely"
 ireland.42.t:0 "The IRA launch the Northern Campaign"
 ireland.42.d:0 "Our contacts within the IRA have informed us that they are now preparing for a major operation to sieze control of Northern Ireland."
 ireland.42.a:0 "Let's hope this doesn't escalate any further..."
 ireland.42.b:0 "Best of luck Boys!"
 ireland.43.t:0 "The IRA begin the Northern Campaign!"
 ireland.43.d:0 "A significant number of IRA forces have crossed the border into Northern Ireland, starting a border conflict with the intent of siezing control of Ulster for the republic!"
 ireland.43.a:0 "Terrible News!"
 ireland.43.b:0 "Request support from [IRE.GetNameDef] to sort things out on their side of the border."
 ireland.44.t:0 "Support from the Ulster Unionists Forms"
 ireland.44.d:0 "Following the IRA incusion into Northern Ireland, the Ulster Volunteer Force has mobilised to aid the Royal Irish Constabulary in repelling the IRA and ensure that Ulster remains seperate from [IRE.GetnameDef]"
 ireland.44.a:0 "Good news at last."
 ireland.45.t:0 "Britain demands support against the IRA in Northern Ireland"
 ireland.45.d:0 "British respesentatives from Northern Ireland have approached us requesting we send Gardai units to the border to help secure it against IRA aggression. Though this would damage our relationship with the IRA, refusing to move against them would make us complicit in this clear attack on British territory, and could put our relationship with Britain and their allies in serious risk."
 ireland.45.a:0 "Send aid to the Border - The IRA shall not drag us into a war!"
 ireland.45.b:0 "We are unable to help at this time."
 ireland.46.t:0 "[IRE.GetNameDef] responds that they are unwilling to move against the IRA"
 ireland.46.d:0 "The [IRE.GetAdjective] representatives have returned to us, saying that the [IRE.GetAdjective] government is currently unable to move against the IRA and suppress the S-Plan saboteurs. Whether they lack the means, will, or desire to move against them remains unclear."
 ireland.46.a:0 "Damn them!"
 ireland.47.t:0 "[IRE.GetnameDef] responds that they have moved against the IRA"
 ireland.47.d:0 "The [IRE.GetAdjective] representatives have returned, bearing news that the [IRE.GetAdjective] government has launched a crackdown against the IRA, and is closely policing traffic due to Britain from Irish ports. This should prevent IRA saboteurs from being able to wreak havoc in Britain for some time."
 ireland.47.a:0 "Good"
 ireland.48.t:0 "[IRE.GetNameDef] responds that they are cracking down on the IRA"
 ireland.48.d:0 "The [IRE.GetAdjective] representatives have returned, bearing newsw that that [IRE.GetAdjective] government has begun a major crackdown on IRA smuggling operations in Irish ports. This should finally put a stop to the saboteurs."
 ireland.48.a:0 "Great!"
 ireland.49.t:0 "[IRE.GetNameDef] sends assistance to Northern Ireland"
 ireland.49.d:0 "The [IRE.GetAdjective] representatives have returned to us promising that several units of the Garda Síochána to aid us in combating the IRA insurgents who are waging an illegal war across the Northern Irish Border"
 ireland.49.a:0 "We send our thanks"
 ireland.50.t:0 "[IRE.GetNameDef] refuses to send assistance to Northern Ireland"
 ireland.50.d:0 "The [IRE.GetAdjective] representative has returned to us expressing that, regretfully, [IRE.GetNameDef] is currently unable to assist us against the IRA attacking us illegally in Northern Ireland. A disappointing result to say the least, some within the Ulster, and even London government are suggesting that the Irish inaction over the northern campaign is tantamount to an official approval, claiming that the [IRE.GetAdjective] government is complicit in the whole affair, despite the supposed peace between our nations."
 ireland.50.a:0 "Damn them!"
 ireland.50.b:0 "If they are not with us, then they must obviously be against us..."
 ireland.52.t:0 "The IRA grows closer to the state"
 ireland.52.d:0 "We have recently noticed a significant increase in pro-government feelings rising amongst the ranks of the IRA, with increased desire to co-operate with the government in establishing a republic free of British influence"
 ireland.52.a:0 "Good to hear!"
 ireland.53.t:0 "IRA growing impatient with the state"
 ireland.53.d:0 "We have noticed that the IRA is becoming increasingly critical of the state, feeling that constitutional change is moving too slow, and we are not doing enough to bring Ulster into [IRE.GetNameDef]."
 ireland.53.a:0 "Worrying..."
 ireland.54.t:0 "IRA recruitment drive"
 ireland.54.d:0 "The IRA have begun a major recuritment drive, greatly increasing their numbers of both active soldiers and supporting agents."
 ireland.54.a:0 "Disconcerting..."
 ireland.55.t:0 "IRA losing popular support"
 ireland.55.d:0 "We have noticed that public support for the work of the IRA seems to be in decline, with more moderate views prevailing, and an increased feeling of unease about the more extreme and militant actions undertaken by the IRA. As a result, the organisation has been significantly weakened."
 ireland.55.a:0 "That soulds like good news..."
 ireland.56.t:0 "Patriots flock to the IRA"
 ireland.56.d:0 "The IRA have undertaken a large recruitment drive by appealing to more moderate views. This has had the dual effect of increasing their strength, but also limiting the influence of more radical ideologies within the organisation, making it more receptive to co-operation with the state"
 ireland.56.a:0 "Well, as long as they remain loyal..."
 ireland.57.t:0 "Moderates desert the IRA"
 ireland.57.d:0 "We have noticed that the IRA has been suffering with increased levels of desersion recently, with more moderate individuals growing dissillusioned with the radical views of the IRA leadership. This has weakened the IRA somewhat, but has also made it more disloyal, as radicals now hold a greater share in its leadership."
 ireland.57.a:0 "Well, so long as they remain weakened..."
 ireland.58.t:0 "IRA has a crisis in leadership"
 ireland.58.d:0 "A recent disagreement within IRA leadership has led into a full-blown schism within its high command. As a result, many disillusioned members have left the organisation, and those that remain now feel themselves too weak to operate completely independently of the state."
 ireland.58.a:0 "Great!"
 ireland.59.t:0 "Dissidents flock to the IRA"
 ireland.59.d:0 "The IRA has begun a large recruitment drive among various opposition groups both inside and outside of mainstream politics. Attracting both radical and moderate opponents of the government alike, the organisation has both grown stronger, and become more assertive in its opposition to the state."
 ireland.59.a:0 "Not good..."
 ireland.60.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] accepts the Coal-Cattle Pact"
 ireland.60.d:0 "Our negotiators have returned to Dublin successful, as their [ENG.GetAdjective] counterparts have agreed to the Coal-Cattle Pact, paving the way for us to begin lowering tarriffs, and weaken the negative effects of the Economic War"
 ireland.60.a:0 "Great!"
 ireland.61.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] refuses the Coal-Cattle Pact"
 ireland.61.d:0 "Our negotiators have returned to Dublin empty-handed, with negotiatons for the Coal-Cattle pact breaking down amid continued demands from the Westminster government to pay the land annuities in full."
 ireland.61.a:0 "What do we do now?"
 ireland.62.t:0 "[ENG.GetAdjective] refuses the Confirmation of Agreements Act"
 ireland.62.d:0 "Negotiatons in Westminster have broken down, following the [ENG.GetAdjective] Parliament rejecting the terms of the act in its final review. We will now have to attempt another course of action if we want to end the Economic War."
 ireland.62.a:0 "What now then?"
 ireland.63.t:0 "Ulster Protestants challenge [IRE.GetNameDef]"
 ireland.63.d:0 "Angered by the privilege we have granted to the Catholic church, and its influence within the state, Protestants in Ulster have begun to organise into cells to resist changes that have been occuring with our occupation of the region."
 ireland.63.a:0 "Concerning..."
 ireland.64.t:0 "Losing control of Northern Ireland!"
 ireland.64.d:0 "Despite the efforts of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the continued attacks by the IRA have been slowly weakening our control over Northern Ireland. If we do not act soon, we are in danger of losing control of the region!"
 ireland.64.a:0 "We must act"
 ireland.65.t:0 "IRA sieze control of Northern Ireland!"
 ireland.65.d:0 "The continued pressure of the IRA in Northern Ireland has exhausted the local defence forces, who have now been forced to yeild to their unrelenting attacks. With the IRA in control of the state, they have moved to hand it over to [IRE.GetNameDef], who have reluctantly accepted ownership. As politicians in Westminster point fingers and now-exiled members of the Ulster Volunteer Forces and the Royal Irish Constabulary come to terms with their defeat, we can only sit back and wonder what to do next."
 ireland.65.a:0 "Sadly, there is nothing we can do..."
 ireland.65.b:0 "We shall return!"
 ireland.66.t:0 "The IRA hands Northern Ireland over to us"
 ireland.66.d:0 "Having ousted British and Unionist defenders in Northern Ireland, the IRA have gained near complete control of the region. Having no governmental capacity in themselves, they have handed over control of the area to us to administer - whether we want it or not. Though this has reunified the island under our control, it will no doubt ruin our relationship with Britain, and could potentially even bring us to war against them. It is also quite possible that once the IRA leave the region, Unionists and Protestants may begin to organise their own resistance once more. It has also had the effect of greatly bolstering the IRA's strength, making them an even stronger and more influential force in Irish politics."
 ireland.66.a:0 "Lets hope that this does not blow up in our face..."
 ireland.67.t:0 "[IRE.GetNameDef] illegally siezes treaty ports!"
 ireland.67.d:0 "We have recieved disturbing news that, completely unprovoked, [IRE.GetAdjective] soldiers entered ports that, in accordance with the 1921 Anglo-Irish treaty, were leased to the Royal Navy for docking and resupply. Thereafter, they blockaded entry to the ports, and declared them sovreign territory of [IRE.GetNameDef], barring entry of any British-flagged vessel. Though this stands as a slight against our authority, and shows no regard for the standing treaties between our two nations, there is relatively little we can do save for military action, an option that is not exactly popular among the British public right now."
 ireland.67.a:0 "Fait accompli, we care not enough for those ports."
 ireland.67.b:0 "This is a slight against us! We demand satisfaction!"
 ireland.68.t:0 "The IRA are preparing a coup!"
 ireland.68.d:0 "Our agents within the IRA have confirmed the dire news to us that the IRA have in fact, put plans into motion to overthrow our government by force. They are already moving men and weapons into position to launch their attack, and the general feelings among their members is that there is no going back now. A revolt is now inevitable. We can only hope that we are properly prepared for when they strike."
 ireland.68.a:0 "The Die is Cast..."
 ireland.69.t:0 "The IRA Revolts!"
 ireland.69.d:0 "The IRA has issued an immediate ultimatum to us, demanding that we with all due urgency, relinquish our control of Ireland to them, so that they can 'properly lead Ireland towards a republic'. We, naturally, have offered a stern rebuke, and have told them that if they want Ireland for themselves, they'll have to come and take it."
 ireland.69.a:0 "The Civil War begins anew..."
 ireland.70.t:0 "Eoin O'Duffy grows close to the IRA"
 ireland.70.d:0 "Formerly one of the largest critics of the IRA, we have notice the Eoin O'Duffy has grown increasinly close to the IRA. Though ordinarily we would say that each man has the right to form his own political opinions and connections, O'Duffy is not only a prominent man within the National Army, but is also the leader of the National Corporate party, which has its own paramilitary branch in the Greenshirts. Should those two forces unite, both would gain a significant amount of strength and infuence over Irish politics"
 ireland.70.a:0 "We cannot allow such an alliance to form"
 ireland.70.b:0 "Mr. O'Duffy can befriend who he pleases"
 ireland.71.t:0 "IRA Defeated!"
 ireland.71.d:0 "We have finally fully defeated the IRA insurgents who rose up against us. With the last of the IRA cells being rounded up and arrested, the Irish Republican Army is no more. Both Ireland and its armed forces are now united once more, and we can now push forward without fear of insurgents threatening Irish democracy."
 ireland.71.a:0 "A Great day for our nation!"
 ireland.72.t:0 "Democratic opposition forming a resistance!"
 ireland.72.d:0 "After we seized control of the Irish government in Dublin, we thought that we had completely crushed the opposition that were leading the Irish republic into the ground, but it seems that some politicians managed to escape, and are now rallying parts of the National Army not yet loyal to the new order against us!"
 ireland.72.a:0 "If they want a fight, they'll get one!"
 ireland.73.t:0 "Democratic opposition launch a revolt!"
 ireland.73.d:0 "Politicians ousted from Dublin have rallied against us, convincing a significant portion of the National Army to turn against us. they have now declared a full-scale war to reclaim Ireland. We must act fast to put down this insurrection, or before long they will have us on a British leash once more!"
 ireland.73.a:0 "Death to traitors!"
 ireland.74.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Defeated!"
 ireland.74.d:0 "The former Dublin politicians who dared to rally disloyal parts of teh National Army have finally been defeated, uniting the Irish state fully under our banner. Now we can at last, get on with building the Free Ireland the Irish people deserve"
