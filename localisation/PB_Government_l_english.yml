Coined in the late 1800s, Sociogenetics largely developed as a response to the Population Boom caused by the Second Renaissance. As the medical sciences advanced, infant mortality dropped rapidly across the civilized world and consequently population numbers increased. In an effort to combat this, Sociogenetics was adopted by many nations in an effort to manage the population and gradually phase out less desirable traits.\n\nIn most countries, this is managed via genetic panel studies intended to detect traits such as abnormally low IQ, deformity, or congenital illness. If such traits are detected, the parent is typically advised to either terminate the pregnancy or report the child for sterilization at the appropriate age. In some nations, this is supplemented through Child Licensure and population counter systems to prevent overcrowding in megacities. Although on paper these systems are not racially motivated, there are innumerable cases of nations targeting certain groups disproportionately over others."

As the Population Explosion hit many nations, there was a need for greater infrastructure and living accomodations. Due to this, there was a push to implement greater population management policies in urban centers. Child licensure policies and hard legal caps on family size have become very common policies in many countries. "

# SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT EVENTS

SocDev.1.t:0 "Decrease in Poverty"
SocDev.1.d:0 "Thanks to our national policies, the country's overall rate of poverty has substantially decreased. Joblessness has been lessened, and standards of living have dramatically improved for the lower class. Slums have begun to gradually empty out, and the crime rate has been impacted substantially by this national shift."
SocDev.1.a:0 "Great!"

SocDev.2.t:0 "Increase in Poverty"
SocDev.2.d:0 "Across the country, destitution has become increasingly commonplace. Jobs have all but dried up in some areas, and many wander the streets looking for any work they can find. It's clear to the government that our policies have increased poverty across the country, dramatically impacting economic health and reducing standards of living. We must do what we can to try and remedy this."
SocDev.2.a:0 "Oh no."

SocDev.3.t:0 "Increased Industrialization"
SocDev.3.d:0 "Factories hum to life, coal is shoveled into boilers and thousands migrate to the cities to pursue new work. Industry has greatly expanded and brought with it all the benefits and curses that it can provide. As agriculture is modernized and mechanized, more and more people look to cities and towns for work, bringing with them the tools and talent needed for a hungry economy. Though this will impact our agricultural base, it will greatly increase our nation's industrial capacity."
SocDev.3.a:0 "Modernism is the way of the future."

SocDev.4.t:0 "Decreased Industrialization"
SocDev.4.d:0 "In the cities, factories lie increasingly empty. Apartment blocks that once thrummed with life are now deathly quiet. More and more, our people look to the agrarian lifestyle for stability and comfort. The economy suffers as the pastoral lifestyle that so many people once lived by becomes more and more commonplace. Our industry will suffer greatly from this social shift, but our agricultural base will benefit from the change."
SocDev.4.a:0 "We must reject modernity."

SocDev.5.t:0 "Increase in Literacy"
SocDev.5.d:0 "Classrooms fill with eager children across our country, ready to learn. Our policies have greatly increased literacy nationwide. Programs in poverty-stricken areas have helped many adults in rural areas go from illiterate to reading at an acceptable level. This increase in national brainpower will help to improve our industrial and economic base as more of the population can make better decisions and learn at a faster rate."
SocDev.5.a:0 "Writing is the cornerstone of civilization"

SocDev.6.t:0 "Decrease in Literacy"
SocDev.6.d:0 "Classrooms lie empty, books sit abandoned on desks, and most people across the country have abandoned the need for higher education. Rural areas languish as even adults lack the capacity for basic reading comprehension, and their children will fare little better as books are tossed aside for menial labor. This will greatly impact our country's capacity to industrialize and will lead to a gradual increase in poverty."
SocDev.6.a:0 "Work is more important than Learning"

SocDev.7.t:0 "Economic Health Improves"
SocDev.7.d:0 "Thanks to our current economic policies we have seen an improvement in our national GDP. Because of this the current health and stability of our economy has greatly improved."
SocDev.7.a:0 "The better the market, the freer the people!"

SocDev.8.t:0 "Economic Health Worsens"
SocDev.8.d:0 "Due to abandoned economic policies or just poor decisions the current health of our economy has unfortunately gotten worse."
SocDev.8.a:0 "Guess money ain't worth as much anymore."

SocDev.9.t:0 "Westernization Increases"
SocDev.9.d:0 "The nation has progressed further on the path to modern, western civilization. Old tribal and gerontocratic practices are being abandoned more and more for Western-style cultural mainstays. Communities become more and more reliant on modern agricultural methods, while some move to the new industrial capitals where smog now chokes the once empty skies. Old ideas fall to the wayside as a new generation looks to Europe for the future.\n\nOur nation shifts further towards becoming a modern, industrial and most importantly Westernized state."
SocDev.9.a:0 "Civilization, Ho!"

SocDev.10.t:0 "A More Modern Military"
SocDev.10.d:0 "Thanks to our military exercises we now have a better military."
SocDev.10.a:0 "\"Sir, yes Sir!\""
